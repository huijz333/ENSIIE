## Dublin treaty
- complete legislation about how immigration is managed in Europe (identification of the migrants...)

- unfair treaty : put most of the responsability on the countries on the borders of europe
(that's why Greece had to handle a lot of migrants inside it borders)

- agreement signed with Turkey

- Germany accepted to welcome 
They signed an agreement with Turkey

## Why is immigration difficult to handle?

#### Societal point of view

- fear of the stranger: different culture, population are scared to have their culture replaced by the migrants one
=> boost far-rights parties (Germany, France)

- Migrant integration
   1 - Should we build new town / activities dedicated to them (=> bad integration)
   2 - integrate them directly into our every-day life (=> conflicts)
   3 - Create specific classes for the youngest migrants


#### Future of immigration

- Climate migrants = time bomb

- Something hard to estimate, mean estimations: 143 million of climate migrant
(South Asia, Sub-saharan, 

IMO : nothing will change until then, and the predicted climate catastrophies will occure in some ways


- Future seems to be quite dark : if the European Union can't handle 2 milions of migrants,
no way the world can find a solution to handle 100 times more
=> Risk of boosting extreme parties
=> History repeats, have to be vigilent
