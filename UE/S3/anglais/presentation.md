## Dublin treaty
- complete legislation about how immigration is managed in Europe (identification of the migrants...)

- unfair treaty : put most of the responsability on the countries on the borders of europe
(that's why Greece had to handle a lot of Syrian migrants inside it borders)

- out of reality treaty : 'Jungle de Calais' was predictable

- agreement signed with Turkey

- Germany welcomed 700 000 migrants (huge contribution to the crisis, France 30 000, 20 times less)

## Why is immigration difficult to handle?

#### Societal point of view

- fear of the stranger: different culture, population are scared to have their culture replaced by the migrants one

- People opinion on immigration is ambigous: as an individual, most people would help someone in need
But when talking about concrete migrants installing in our cities, people are closing in on themselves

=> immgration may boost far-rights parties (Germany, France)
But that's not always true (c.f Greece)
The main reason of rights parties scores is mainly the economic situation

#### Integration

- Migrant integration
   1 - Should we build new town / activities dedicated to them (=> bad integration)
   2 - integrate them directly into our every-day life (=> conflicts)
   3 - Create specific classes for the youngest migrants


## Future of immigration

- Climate migrants = time bomb

- Something hard to estimate, mean estimations: 143 million of climate migrant
(South Asia, Sub-saharan, 

IMO : nothing will change until then, and the predicted climate catastrophies will occure in some ways

- Natural resources (oil, gaz, uranium) already are creating conflicts in middle-east countries
=> Conflicts may increase as the resources stocks diminish

- Future seems to be quite dark : if the European Union can't handle 2 milions of migrants,
no way the world can find a solution to handle 100 times more
=> Risk of boosting extreme parties (can't neatly separate ‘refugees’ from ‘economic migrants’)
=> History repeats, have to be vigilent : find transparent solutions for refugees
