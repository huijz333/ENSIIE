# Five myths about the refugee crisis

This article deconstructs 5 myths about the refugee crisis that 'started' in 2015

## Myth 1 : 'The crisis is over'
- The refugee crisis was extremly mediatized between 2015 and 2016, as an unusually high amount of people (3 million) claim asylum in Europe

- European chaotic way of handling immigration : Dublin treaty, borders, budgets...

- Syrians

- Nothing changed in Europe since (war are continuing, no sustainable policy for immigration)

## Myth 2 : We can seperate 'refugees' from 'economic migrants'
- negative meaning of 'economic migrant' ('fake' migrants, who wants to abuse western systems)
