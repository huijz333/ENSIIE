              Is  used to install the latest version of a package or group of packages while ensuring that all depen‚Äê[m
              dencies are satisfied.  (See [1mSpecifying[0m [1mpackage[0m [1mnames[0m for more information) If no package  matches  the[m
              given  package  name(s), they are assumed to be a shell glob and any matches are then installed. If the[m
              name starts with @^ then it is treated as an environment group (group install @^foo),  an  @  character[m
              and it's treated as a group (plain group install).[m
[m
              If  the  name starts with a "-" character, then a search is done within the transaction and any matches[m
              are removed. Note that Yum options use the same syntax and it may be necessary to use "--"  to  resolve[m
              any possible conflicts.[m
[m
              If  the name is a file, then install works like localinstall. If the name doesn't match a package, then[m
              package  "provides"  are   searched   (e.g.   "_sqlitecache.so()(64bit)")   as   are   file[7mlist[27ms   (Eg.[m
              "/usr/bin/yum"). Also note that for file[7mlist[27ms, wildcards will match multiple packages.[m
[m
              Because install does a lot of work to make it as easy as possible to use, there are also a few specific[m
              install commands "[1minstall-n[0m", "[1minstall-na[0m" and "[1minstall-nevra[0m". These only work on package  names,  and[m
              do not process wildcards etc.[m

       [1mupdate[0m If  run  without  any  packages,  update will update every currently installed package.  If one or more[m
              packages or package globs are specified, Yum will only update  the  [7mlist[27med  packages.   While  updating[m
              packages,  [1myum[0m  will ensure that all dependencies are satisfied. (See [1mSpecifying[0m [1mpackage[0m [1mnames[0m for more[m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       The dhcpd.conf file contains configuration information for [4mdhcpd,[24m the Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Server.[m
[m
       The  dhcpd.conf  file is a free-form ASCII text file.  It is parsed by the recursive-descent parser built into[m
       dhcpd.  The file may contain extra tabs and newlines for formatting purposes.  Keywords in the file are  case-[m
       insensitive.  Comments may be placed anywhere within the file (except within quotes).  Comments begin with the[m
       # character and end at the end of the line.[m
[m
       The file essentially consists of a list of statements.  Statements fall into two broad categories - parameters[m
       and declarations.[m
[m
       Parameter statements either say how to do something (e.g., how long a lease to offer), whether to do something[m
       (e.g., should dhcpd provide addresses to unknown clients), or what parameters to provide to the client  (e.g.,[m
       use gateway 220.177.244.7).[m
[m
       Declarations  are used to describe the topology of the network, to describe clients on the network, to provide[m
       addresses that can be assigned to clients, or to apply a group of parameters to a group of  declarations.   In[m
       any  group  of  parameters  and  declarations,  all parameters must be specified before any declarations which[m
       depend on those parameters may be specified.[m
[m
       Declarations about network topology include the [4mshared-network[24m and the [4msubnet[24m declarations.  If clients  on  a[m
       subnet  are  to  be assigned addresses dynamically, a [4mrange[24m declaration must appear within the [4msubnet[24m declara‚Äê[m
       tion.  For clients with statically assigned addresses, or for installations where only known clients  will  be[m
       served, each such client must have a [4mhost[24m declaration.  If parameters are to be applied to a group of declara‚Äê[m
       tions which are not related strictly on a per-subnet basis, the [4mgroup[24m declaration can be used.[m
[m
       For every subnet which will be served, and for every subnet to which the dhcp server is connected, there  must[m
       be  one  [4msubnet[24m  declaration,  which tells dhcpd how to recognize that an address is on that subnet.  A [4msubnet[24m[m
       declaration is required for each subnet even if no addresses will be dynamically allocated on that subnet.[m
[m
       Some installations have physical networks on which more than one IP subnet operates.  For example, if there is[m

[m
       Note that even when the [4mshared-network[24m declaration is absent, an empty one is created by the server to contain[m
       the  [4msubnet[24m  (and  any  scoped  parameters  included  in the [4msubnet[24m).  For practical purposes, this means that[m

       Some  sites  may have departments which have clients on more than one subnet, but it may be desirable to offer[m
       those clients a uniform set of parameters which are different than what would be offered to clients from other[m
       departments  on  the same subnet.  For clients which will be declared explicitly with [4mhost[24m declarations, these[m
       declarations can be enclosed in a [4mgroup[24m declaration along with the parameters which are common to that depart‚Äê[m
       ment.   For  clients whose addresses will be dynamically assigned, class declarations and conditional declara‚Äê[m
       tions may be used to group parameter assignments based on information the client sends.[m
[m
       When a client is to be booted, its boot parameters are determined by consulting that client's [4mhost[24m declaration[m

       [4mshared-network[24m declarations for the IP address assigned to the client.   Each  of  these  declarations  itself[m
       appears  within  a  lexical scope, and all declarations at less specific lexical scopes are also consulted for[m
       client option declarations.  Scopes are never considered twice, and if parameters are declared  in  more  than[m

       Notice that at the beginning of the file, there's a place for global parameters.  These might be  things  like[m
       the  organization's domain name, the addresses of the name servers (if they are common to the entire organiza‚Äê[m
       tion), and so on.  So, for example:[m
[m
            option domain-name "isc.org";[m
            option domain-name-servers ns1.isc.org, ns2.isc.org;[m

[m
       As you can see in Figure 2, you can specify host addresses in parameters using their domain names rather  than[m
       their  numeric  IP  addresses.  If a given hostname resolves to more than one IP address (for example, if that[m

[m
       The most obvious reason for having subnet-specific parameters as shown in Figure 1 is  that  each  subnet,  of[m
       necessity, has its own router.  So for the first subnet, for example, there should be something like:[m
[m
            option routers 204.254.239.1;[m
[m
       Note  that  the  address here is specified numerically.  This is not required - if you have a different domain[m
       name for each interface on your router, it's perfectly legitimate to use the domain name  for  that  interface[m
       instead  of  the  numeric  address.   However,  in  many  cases there may be only one domain name for all of a[m
       router's IP addresses, and it would not be appropriate to use that name here.[m
[m
       In Figure 1 there is also a [4mgroup[24m statement, which provides common parameters for  a  set  of  three  hosts  -[m
       zappo,  beppo  and  harpo.   As  you can see, these hosts are all in the test.isc.org domain, so it might make[m
       sense for a group-specific parameter to override the domain name supplied to these hosts:[m
[m
            option domain-name "test.isc.org";[m
[m
       Also, given the domain they're in, these are probably test machines.  If we wanted to test  the  DHCP  leasing[m
       mechanism, we might set the lease timeout somewhat shorter than the default:[m
[m
            max-lease-time 120;[m
            default-lease-time 120;[m
[m
       You may have noticed that while some parameters start with the [4moption[24m keyword, some do not.  Parameters start‚Äê[m
       ing with the [4moption[24m keyword correspond to actual DHCP options, while parameters that do  not  start  with  the[m
       option keyword either control the behavior of the DHCP server (e.g., how long a lease dhcpd will give out), or[m
       specify client parameters that are not optional in the DHCP protocol (for example, server-name and filename).[m
[m
       In Figure 1, each host had [4mhost-specific[24m [4mparameters[24m.  These could include such things as the [4mhostname[24m  option,[m
       the  name  of a file to upload (the [4mfilename[24m parameter) and the address of the server from which to upload the[m
       file (the [4mnext-server[24m parameter).  In general, any parameter can appear anywhere that parameters are  allowed,[m
       and will be applied according to the scope in which the parameter appears.[m
[m
       Imagine  that you have a site with a lot of NCD X-Terminals.  These terminals come in a variety of models, and[m
       you want to specify the boot files for each model.  One way to do this would be to have host declarations  for[m
       each server and group them by model:[m

[1mADDRESS[0m [1mPOOLS[0m[m
       The  [1mpool[0m declaration can be used to specify a pool of addresses that will be treated differently than another[m
       pool of addresses, even on the same network segment or subnet.  For example, you may want to provide  a  large[m
       set of addresses that can be assigned to DHCP clients that are registered to your DHCP server, while providing[m
       a smaller set of addresses, possibly with short lease times, that are available for unknown clients.   If  you[m
       have  a firewall, you may be able to arrange for addresses from one pool to be allowed access to the Internet,[m
       while addresses in another pool are not, thus encouraging users to register their DHCP clients.  To  do  this,[m
       you would set up a pair of pool declarations:[m

         }[m
       }[m
[m
       It  is  also possible to set up entirely different subnets for known and unknown clients - address pools exist[m
       at the level of shared networks, so address ranges within pool declarations can be on different subnets.[m
[m
       As you can see in the preceding example, pools can have permit lists that control which  clients  are  allowed[m
       access  to the pool and which aren't.  Each entry in a pool's permit list is introduced with the [4mallow[24m or [4mdeny[24m[m
       keyword.  If a pool has a permit list, then only those clients that match specific entries on the permit  list[m
       will  be  eligible to be assigned addresses from the pool.  If a pool has a deny list, then only those clients[m
       that do not match any entries on the deny list will be eligible.   If both permit and deny lists exist  for  a[m
       pool, then only clients that match the permit list and do not match the deny list will be allowed access.[m
[m
[1mDYNAMIC[0m [1mADDRESS[0m [1mALLOCATION[0m[m
       Address  allocation  is actually only done when a client is in the INIT state and has sent a DHCPDISCOVER mes‚Äê[m
       sage.  If the client thinks it has a valid lease and sends a DHCPREQUEST to initiate or renew that lease,  the[m
       server  has  only  three  choices - it can ignore the DHCPREQUEST, send a DHCPNAK to tell the client it should[m
       stop using the address, or send a DHCPACK, telling the client to go ahead and use the address for a while.[m
[m
       If the server finds the address the client is requesting, and that address is available  to  the  client,  the[m
       server  will send a DHCPACK.  If the address is no longer available, or the client isn't permitted to have it,[m
[7m Manual page dhcpd.conf(5) line 189/1945 11% (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K       the server will send a DHCPNAK.  If the server knows nothing about the address, it will remain silent,  unless[m
       the  address  is  incorrect  for  the  network segment to which the client has been attached and the server is[m
       authoritative for that network segment, in which case the server will send a DHCPNAK even  though  it  doesn't[m
       know about the address.[m
[m
       There  may  be  a  host declaration matching the client's identification.  If that host declaration contains a[m
       fixed-address declaration that lists an IP address that is valid for the network segment to which  the  client[m
       is  connected.   In  this  case,  the DHCP server will never do dynamic address allocation.  In this case, the[m
       client is [4mrequired[24m to take the address specified in the host declaration.  If the client sends  a  DHCPREQUEST[m
       for some other address, the server will respond with a DHCPNAK.[m
[m
       When  the DHCP server allocates a new address for a client (remember, this only happens if the client has sent[m
       a DHCPDISCOVER), it first looks to see if the client already has a valid lease on an IP address, or  if  there[m
       is  an  old  IP  address the client had before that hasn't yet been reassigned.  In that case, the server will[m
       take that address and check it to see if the client is still permitted to use it.  If the client is no  longer[m
       permitted  to  use it, the lease is freed if the server thought it was still in use - the fact that the client[m
       has sent a DHCPDISCOVER proves to the server that the client is no longer using the lease.[m
[m
       If no existing lease is found, or if the client is forbidden to receive the existing lease,  then  the  server[m
       will  look  in  the  list of address pools for the network segment to which the client is attached for a lease[m
       that is not in use and that the client is permitted to have.   It  looks  through  each  pool  declaration  in[m
       sequence  (all [4mrange[24m declarations that appear outside of pool declarations are grouped into a single pool with[m
       no permit list).  If the permit list for the pool allows the client to be allocated an address from that pool,[m
       the  pool is examined to see if there is an address available.  If so, then the client is tentatively assigned[m
       that address.  Otherwise, the next pool is tested.  If no addresses are found that  can  be  assigned  to  the[m
       client, no response is sent to the client.[m
[m
       If  an  address  is found that the client is permitted to have, and that has never been assigned to any client[m
       before, the address is immediately allocated to the client.  If the address is available  for  allocation  but[m
       has  been  previously  assigned  to  a  different  client, the server will keep looking in hopes of finding an[m
       address that has never before been assigned to a client.[m
[m
       The DHCP server generates the list of available IP addresses from a hash table.  This means that the addresses[m
       are  not  sorted  in  any  particular  order, and so it is not possible to predict the order in which the DHCP[m
       server will allocate IP addresses.  Users of previous versions of the ISC DHCP server may have  become  accus‚Äê[m
       tomed to the DHCP server allocating IP addresses in ascending order, but this is no longer possible, and there[m
       is no way to configure this behavior with version 3 of the ISC DHCP server.[m

       The DHCP server checks IP addresses to see if they are in use before allocating them to clients.  It does this[m
       by  sending an ICMP Echo request message to the IP address being allocated.  If no ICMP Echo reply is received[m
       within a second, the address is assumed to be free.  This is only done for leases that have been specified  in[m
       range  statements, and only when the lease is thought by the DHCP server to be free - i.e., the DHCP server or[m
       its failover peer has not listed the lease as in use.[m
[m
       If a response is received to an ICMP Echo request, the DHCP server assumes that there is a configuration error[m
       -  the  IP  address  is in use by some host on the network that is not a DHCP client.  It marks the address as[m
       abandoned, and will not assign it to clients.[m
[m
       If a DHCP client tries to get an IP address, but none are available, but there  are  abandoned  IP  addresses,[m
       then  the  DHCP  server will attempt to reclaim an abandoned IP address.  It marks one IP address as free, and[m
       then does the same ICMP Echo request check described previously.  If there is  no  answer  to  the  ICMP  Echo[m
       request, the address is assigned to the client.[m
[m
       The  DHCP  server does not cycle through abandoned IP addresses if the first IP address it tries to reclaim is[m
       free.  Rather, when the next DHCPDISCOVER comes in from the client, it will attempt a new allocation using the[m
       same method described here, and will typically try a new IP address.[m
[m
[1mDHCP[0m [1mFAILOVER[0m[m
       This  version  of  the  ISC  DHCP  server supports the DHCP failover protocol as documented in draft-ietf-dhc-[m
       failover-12.txt.  This is not a final protocol document, and we have not done  interoperability  testing  with[m
       other  vendors'  implementations of this protocol, so you must not assume that this implementation conforms to[m
       the standard.  If you wish to use the failover protocol, make sure that both failover peers  are  running  the[m
       same version of the ISC DHCP server.[m
[m
       The  failover  protocol  allows  two DHCP servers (and no more than two) to share a common address pool.  Each[m
       server will have about half of the available IP addresses in the pool at any given time  for  allocation.   If[m
       one  server  fails,  the  other  server  will  continue to renew leases out of the pool, and will allocate new[m
       addresses out of the roughly half of available addresses that it had when communications with the other server[m
       were lost.[m

       You  can put the server into the PARTNER-DOWN state either by using the [1momshell[0m [1m(1)[0m command or by stopping the[m
       server, editing the last failover state declaration in the lease file, and restarting the server.  If you  use[m
       this last method, change the "my state" line to:[m

       It is only required to change "my state" as shown above.[m
[m
       When the other server comes back online, it should automatically detect that it has been offline and request a[m
       complete update from the server that was running in the PARTNER-DOWN state, and then both servers will  resume[m
       processing together.[m
[m
       It  is possible to get into a dangerous situation: if you put one server into the PARTNER-DOWN state, and then[m
       *that* server goes down, and the other server comes back up, the other server will not  know  that  the  first[m
       server was in the PARTNER-DOWN state, and may issue addresses previously issued by the other server to differ‚Äê[m
       ent clients, resulting in IP address conflicts.  Before putting a server into PARTNER-DOWN  state,  therefore,[m
       make [4msure[24m that the other server will not restart automatically.[m
[m
       The  failover  protocol defines a primary server role and a secondary server role.  There are some differences[m
       in how primaries and secondaries act, but most of the differences simply have to do with providing a  way  for[m
       each  peer to behave in the opposite way from the other.  So one server must be configured as primary, and the[m
       other must be configured as secondary, and it doesn't matter too much which one is which.[m
[m
[1mFAILOVER[0m [1mSTARTUP[0m[m
       When a server starts that has not previously communicated with its failover peer, it must establish communica‚Äê[m
       tions  with  its  failover  peer  and synchronize with it before it can serve clients.  This can happen either[m
       because you have just configured your DHCP servers to perform failover for the first time, or because  one  of[m
       your failover servers has failed catastrophically and lost its database.[m
[m
       The  initial  recovery  process  is designed to ensure that when one failover peer loses its database and then[m
       resynchronizes, any leases that the failed server gave out before it failed will be honored.  When the  failed[m
       server starts up, it notices that it has no saved failover state, and attempts to contact its peer.[m
[m
[7m Manual page dhcpd.conf(5) line 300/1945 18% (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K       When  it  has  established  contact, it asks the peer for a complete copy its peer's lease database.  The peer[m
       then sends its complete database, and sends a message indicating that it is  done.   The  failed  server  then[m
       waits until MCLT has passed, and once MCLT has passed both servers make the transition back into normal opera‚Äê[m
       tion.  This waiting period ensures that any leases the failed server may have given out while out  of  contact[m
       with its partner will have expired.[m
[m
       While  the  failed server is recovering, its partner remains in the partner-down state, which means that it is[m
       serving all clients.  The failed server provides no service at all to DHCP clients until it has made the tran‚Äê[m
       sition into normal operation.[m
[m
       In  the  case where both servers detect that they have never before communicated with their partner, they both[m
       come up in this recovery state and follow the procedure we have just described.  In this case, no service will[m
       be provided to DHCP clients until MCLT has expired.[m
[m
[1mCONFIGURING[0m [1mFAILOVER[0m[m
       In  order  to  configure failover, you need to write a peer declaration that configures the failover protocol,[m
       and you need to write peer references in each pool declaration for which you want to do failover.  You do  not[m
       have  to  do  failover  for  all  pools  on a given network segment.   You must not tell one server it's doing[m
       failover on a particular address pool and tell the other it is not.  You must  not  have  any  common  address[m
       pools on which you are not doing failover.  A pool declaration that utilizes failover would look like this:[m
[m
       pool {[m
            failover peer "foo";[m
            [4mpool[24m [4mspecific[24m [4mparameters[24m[m
       };[m
[m
       Dynamic  BOOTP leases are not compatible with failover, and, as such, you need to disallow BOOTP in pools that[m
       you are using failover for.[m
[m
       The  server currently  does very  little  sanity checking,  so if  you configure it wrong, it will just   fail[m
       in  odd ways.  I would recommend therefore that you either do  failover or don't do failover, but don't do any[m
       mixed pools.  Also,  use the same master configuration file for both  servers,  and  have   a   separate  file[m
       that  contains  the  peer declaration and includes the master file.  This will help you to avoid configuration[m
       mismatches.  As our  implementation evolves,  this will  become   less  of   a   problem.   A   basic   sample[m
       dhcpd.conf  file for  a primary server might look like this:[m

         The  split  statement specifies the split between the primary and secondary for the purposes of load balanc‚Äê[m
         ing.  Whenever a client makes a DHCP request, the DHCP server runs a  hash  on  the  client  identification,[m
         resulting  in value from 0 to 255.  This is used as an index into a 256 bit field.  If the bit at that index[m
         is set, the primary is responsible.  If the bit at that index is not set, the secondary is responsible.  The[m
         [1msplit[0m  value  determines  how many of the leading bits are set to one.  So, in practice, higher split values[m
         will cause the primary to serve more clients than the secondary.  Lower split values, the  converse.   Legal[m

         timer,  the  server  will  automatically  enter the partner-down state.  This permits the server to allocate[m
         leases from the partner's free lease pool after an STOS+MCLT timer expires, which can be  dangerous  if  the[m

         This version of the DHCP Server evaluates pool balance on a schedule, rather than on demand  as  leases  are[m
         allocated.   The  latter  approach  proved  to  be slightly klunky when pool misbalanced reach total satura‚Äê[m
         tion...when any server ran out of leases to assign, it also lost its ability to notice it had run dry.[m
[m
         In order to understand pool balance, some elements of its operation first need to be defined.  First,  there[m
         are  ¬¥free¬¥ and ¬¥backup¬¥ leases.  Both of these are referred to as ¬¥free state leases¬¥.  ¬¥free¬¥ and ¬¥backup¬¥[m
         are ¬¥the free states¬¥ for the purpose of this document.  The difference is that only the primary  may  allo‚Äê[m
         cate  from  ¬¥free¬¥  leases  unless under special circumstances, and only the secondary may allocate ¬¥backup¬¥[m
         leases.[m
[m
         When pool balance is performed, the only plausible expectation is to provide a 50/50 split of the free state[m
         leases  between  the  two servers.  This is because no one can predict which server will fail, regardless of[m
         the relative load placed upon the two servers, so giving each server half the leases gives both servers  the[m
         same  amount  of ¬¥failure endurance¬¥.  Therefore, there is no way to configure any different behaviour, out‚Äê[m
         side of some very small windows we will describe shortly.[m
[m
         The first thing calculated on any pool balance run is a value referred to as ¬¥lts¬¥,  or  "Leases  To  Send".[m
         This,  simply, is the difference in the count of free and backup leases, divided by two.  For the secondary,[m
         it is the difference in the backup and free leases, divided by two.  The resulting value is signed: if it is[m
         positive, the local server is expected to hand out leases to retain a 50/50 balance.  If it is negative, the[m
         remote server would need to send leases to balance the pool.  Once the lts value reaches zero, the  pool  is[m
         perfectly balanced (give or take one lease in the case of an odd number of total free state leases).[m

         The  current approach is still something of a hybrid of the old approach, marked by the presence of the [1mmax-[0m[m
         [1mlease-misbalance[0m statement.  This parameter configures what used to be a 10% fixed value  in  previous  ver‚Äê[m
         sions: if lts is less than free+backup * [1mmax-lease-misbalance[0m percent, then the server will skip balancing a[m

         value  is  also  somewhat  overloaded, however, in that it also governs the estimation of when to attempt to[m
         balance the pool (which may then also be skipped over).  The oldest leases in the free and backup states are[m
         examined.  The time they have resided in their respective queues is used as an estimate to indicate how much[m
         time it is probable it would take before the leases at the top of the list would be consumed (and thus,  how[m
         long  it  would take to use all leases in that state).  This percentage is directly multiplied by this time,[m
         and fit into the schedule if it falls within the [1mmin-balance[0m and [1mmax-balance[0m configured values.  The  sched‚Äê[m
         uled  pool  check time is only moved in a downwards direction, it is never increased.  Lastly, if the lts is[m
         more than double this number in the negative direction,  the  local  server  will  ¬¥panic¬¥  and  transmit  a[m
         Failover protocol POOLREQ message, in the hopes that the remote system will be woken up into action.[m
[m
         Once  the  lts  value  exceeds  the  [1mmax-lease-misbalance[0m percentage of total free state leases as described[m
         above, leases are moved to the remote server.  This is done in two passes.[m
[m
         In the first pass, only leases whose most recent bound client would have been served by the remote server  -[m
         according  to the Load Balance Algorithm (see above [1msplit[0m and [1mhba[0m configuration statements) - are given away[m
         to the peer.  This first pass will happily continue to give away leases, decrementing the lts value  by  one[m
         for  each, until the lts value has reached the negative of the total number of leases multiplied by the [1mmax-[0m[m
         [1mlease-ownership[0m percentage.  So it is through this value that you can permit a small misbalance of the lease[m
         pools - for the purpose of giving the peer more than a 50/50 share of leases in the hopes that their clients[m
         might some day return and be allocated by the peer (operating normally).  This process  is  referred  to  as[m
         ¬¥MAC Address Affinity¬¥, but this is somewhat misnamed: it applies equally to DHCP Client Identifier options.[m
         Note also that affinity is applied to leases when they enter the state ¬¥free¬¥ from ¬¥expired¬¥ or  ¬¥released¬¥.[m
         In  this  case also, leases will not be moved from free to backup if the secondary already has more than its[m
         share.[m
[m
         The second pass is only entered into if the first pass fails to reduce the lts underneath the  total  number[m
         of  free state leases multiplied by the [1mmax-lease-ownership[0m percentage.  In this pass, the oldest leases are[m
         given over to the peer without second thought about the Load Balance Algorithm, and this continues until the[m
         lts  falls under this value.  In this way, the local server will also happily keep a small percentage of the[m
         leases that would normally load balance to itself.[m
[m
         So, the [1mmax-lease-misbalance[0m value acts as a behavioural gate.  Smaller values will  cause  more  leases  to[m
         transition  states to balance the pools over time, higher values will decrease the amount of change (but may[m
         lead to pool starvation if there's a run on leases).[m
[m
         The [1mmax-lease-ownership[0m value permits a small (percentage) skew in the lease balance of a percentage of  the[m

         Finally, the [1mmin-balance[0m and [1mmax-balance[0m make certain that a scheduled rebalance event happens within a rea‚Äê[m
         sonable timeframe (not to be thrown off by, for example, a 7 year old free lease).[m
[m
         Plausible values for the percentages lie between 0 and 100, inclusive, but values over 50 are indistinguish‚Äê[m
         able from one another (once lts exceeds 50% of the free state leases, one server must therefore have 100% of[m
         the leases in its respective free state).  It is recommended to select a [1mmax-lease-ownership[0m value  that  is[m
         lower  than  the value selected for the [1mmax-lease-misbalance[0m value.  [1mmax-lease-ownership[0m defaults to 10, and[m
         [1mmax-lease-misbalance[0m defaults to 15.[m
[m
         Plausible values for the [1mmin-balance[0m and [1mmax-balance[0m times also range from 0 to (2^32)-1 (or  the  limit  of[m
         your  local time_t value), but default to values 60 and 3600 respectively (to place balance events between 1[m
         minute and 1 hour).[m

[1mCLIENT[0m [1mCLASSING[0m[m
       Clients can be separated into classes, and treated differently depending on what class they are in.  This sep‚Äê[m
       aration  can  be done either with a conditional statement, or with a match statement within the class declara‚Äê[m
       tion.  It is possible to specify a limit on the total number of clients within a particular class or  subclass[m
       that may hold leases at one time, and it is possible to specify automatic subclassing based on the contents of[m
       the client packet.[m
[m
       To add clients to classes based on conditional evaluation, you can specify a matching expression in the  class[m
       statement:[m
[m
       class "ras-clients" {[m
         match if substring (option dhcp-client-identifier, 1, 3) = "RAS";[m
       }[m
[m
       Note  that  whether  you  use  matching  expressions or add statements (or both) to classify clients, you must[m
       always write a class declaration for any class that you use.  If there will be no match statement and  no  in-[m
       scope statements for a class, the declaration should look like this:[m
[m
       class "ras-clients" {[m

       Many cable modem head-end systems can be configured to add a Relay Agent Information option  to  DHCP  packets[m
       when  relaying  them  to  the  DHCP server.  These systems typically add a circuit ID or remote ID option that[m
       uniquely identifies the customer site.  To take advantage of this, you can write a class declaration  as  fol‚Äê[m
       lows:[m
[m
       class "customer" {[m
         spawn with option agent.circuit-id;[m
         lease limit 4;[m
       }[m
[m
       Now  whenever  a  request  comes  in  from  a customer site, the circuit ID option will be checked against the[m
       class's hash table.  If a subclass is found that matches the circuit ID, the client will be classified in that[m
       subclass  and treated accordingly.  If no subclass is found matching the circuit ID, a new one will be created[m
       and logged in the [1mdhcpd.leases[0m file, and the client will be classified in this new class.  Once the client has[m
       been  classified,  it will be treated according to the rules of the class, including, in this case, being sub‚Äê[m
       ject to the per-site limit of four leases.[m
[m
       The use of the subclass spawning mechanism is not restricted to relay agent options - this particular  example[m

       In  some  cases, it may be useful to use one expression to assign a client to a particular class, and a second[m

       therefore does not attempt to set up an A record for the client, but does set up  a  PTR  record  for  the  [7mIP[27m[m
       address  that  it assigns the client, pointing at jschmoe.radish.org.  Once the DHCP client has an [7mIP[27m address,[m
       it can update its own A record, assuming that the "radish.org" DNS server will allow it to do so.[m
[m
       If the server is configured not to allow client updates, or if the client doesn¬¥t want to do its  own  update,[m
       the  server  will simply choose a name for the client from either the fqdn option (if present) or the hostname[m
       option (if present).  It will use its own domain name for the client.  It will then update both the A and  PTR[m
       record, using the name that it chose for the client.  If the client sends a fully-qualified domain name in the[m
       [1mfqdn[0m option, the server uses only the leftmost part of the domain name  -  in  the  example  above,  "jschmoe"[m
       instead of "jschmoe.radish.org".[m
[m
       Further,  if the [4mignore[24m [4mclient-updates;[24m directive is used, then the server will in addition send a response in[m
       the DHCP packet, using the FQDN Option, that implies to the client that it should perform its own  updates  if[m
       it chooses to do so.  With [4mdeny[24m [4mclient-updates;[24m, a response is sent which indicates the client may not perform[m
       updates.[m
[m
       Also, if the [4muse-host-decl-names[24m configuration option is enabled, then the host declaration¬¥s [4mhostname[24m will be[m
       used in place of the [4mhostname[24m option, and the same rules will apply as described above.[m
[m
       Both  the  standard and interim options also include a method to allow more than one DHCP server to update the[m
       DNS database without accidentally deleting A records that shouldn¬¥t be deleted nor failing to  add  A  records[m
       that should be added.  For the standard option the method works as follows:[m
[m
       When  the  DHCP server issues a client a new lease, it creates a text string that is an SHA hash over the DHCP[m
       client¬¥s identification (see RFCs 4701 & 4702 for details).  The update attempts to add an A record  with  the[m
       name  the  server  chose  and a DHCID record containing the hashed identifier string (hashid).  If this update[m
       succeeds, the server is done.[m
[m
       If the update fails because the A record already exists, then the DHCP server attempts to  add  the  A  record[m
       with  the  prerequisite that there must be a DHCID record in the same name as the new A record, and that DHCID[m
       record¬¥s contents must be equal to hashid.  If this update succeeds, then the client has its A record and  PTR[m
       record.   If  it fails, then the name the client has been assigned (or requested) is in use, and can¬¥t be used[m
       by the client.  At this point the DHCP server gives up trying to do a DNS update  for  the  client  until  the[m
       client chooses a new name.[m
[m
       The  server  also does not update very aggressively.  Because each DNS update involves a round tr[7mip[27m to the DNS[m
       server, there is a cost associated with doing updates even if they do not actually modify  the  DNS  database.[m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       The dhcpd.conf file contains configuration information for [4mdhcpd,[24m the Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Server.[m
[m
       The  dhcpd.conf  file is a free-form ASCII text file.  It is parsed by the recursive-descent parser built into[m
       dhcpd.  The file may contain extra tabs and newlines for formatting purposes.  Keywords in the file are  case-[m
       insensitive.  Comments may be placed anywhere within the file (except within quotes).  Comments begin with the[m
       # character and end at the end of the line.[m
[m
       The file essentially consists of a list of statements.  Statements fall into two broad categories - parameters[m
       and declarations.[m
[m
       Parameter statements either say how to do something (e.g., how long a lease to offer), whether to do something[m
       (e.g., should dhcpd provide addresses to unknown clients), or what parameters to provide to the client  (e.g.,[m
       use gateway 220.177.244.7).[m
[m
       Declarations  are used to describe the topology of the network, to describe clients on the network, to provide[m
       addresses that can be assigned to clients, or to apply a group of parameters to a group of  declarations.   In[m
       any  group  of  parameters  and  declarations,  all parameters must be specified before any declarations which[m
       depend on those parameters may be specified.[m
[m
       Declarations about network topology include the [4mshared-network[24m and the [4msubnet[24m declarations.  If clients  on  a[m
       subnet  are  to  be assigned addresses dynamically, a [4mrange[24m declaration must appear within the [4msubnet[24m declara‚Äê[m
       tion.  For clients with statically assigned addresses, or for installations where only known clients  will  be[m
       served, each such client must have a [4mhost[24m declaration.  If parameters are to be applied to a group of declara‚Äê[m
       tions which are not related strictly on a per-subnet basis, the [4mgroup[24m declaration can be used.[m

       the  same  ethernet until such time as a new physical network can be added.  In this case, the [4msubnet[24m declara‚Äê[m
       tions for these two networks must be enclosed in a [4mshared-network[24m declaration.[m
[m
       Note that even when the [4mshared-network[24m declaration is absent, an empty one is created by the server to contain[m
       the  [4msubnet[24m  (and  any  scoped  parameters  included  in the [4msubnet[24m).  For practical purposes, this means that[m
       "stateless" DHCP clients, which are not tied to addresses (and therefore subnets) will receive the  same  con‚Äê[m
       figuration as stateful ones.[m
[m
       Some  sites  may have departments which have clients on more than one subnet, but it may be desirable to offer[m
       those clients a uniform set of parameters which are different than what would be offered to clients from other[m
       departments  on  the same subnet.  For clients which will be declared explicitly with [4mhost[24m declarations, these[m
       declarations can be enclosed in a [4mgroup[24m declaration along with the parameters which are common to that depart‚Äê[m

       client option declarations.  Scopes are never considered twice, and if parameters are declared  in  more  than[m

       The most obvious reason for having subnet-specific parameters as shown in Figure 1 is  that  each  subnet,  of[m
[7m Manual page dhcpd.conf(5) line 80 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K/[K       necessity, has its own router.  So for the first subnet, for example, there should be something like:[m

       Note  that  the  address here is specified numerically.  This is not required - if you have a different domain[m
[7m Manual page dhcpd.conf(5) line 85 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K/[K       name for each interface on your router, it's perfectly legitimate to use the domain name  for  that  interface[m
       instead  of  the  numeric  address.   However,  in  many  cases there may be only one domain name for all of a[m
       router's IP addresses, and it would not be appropriate to use that name here.[m
[m
       In Figure 1 there is also a [4mgroup[24m statement, which provides common parameters for  a  set  of  three  hosts  -[m
       zappo,  beppo  and  harpo.   As  you can see, these hosts are all in the test.isc.org domain, so it might make[m
       sense for a group-specific parameter to override the domain name supplied to these hosts:[m
[m
            option domain-name "test.isc.org";[m
[m
       Also, given the domain they're in, these are probably test machines.  If we wanted to test  the  DHCP  leasing[m
       mechanism, we might set the lease timeout somewhat shorter than the default:[m
[m
            max-lease-time 120;[m
            default-lease-time 120;[m
[m
       You may have noticed that while some parameters start with the [4moption[24m keyword, some do not.  Parameters start‚Äê[m
       ing with the [4moption[24m keyword correspond to actual DHCP options, while parameters that do  not  start  with  the[m
       option keyword either control the behavior of the DHCP server (e.g., how long a lease dhcpd will give out), or[m

       In Figure 1, each host had [4mhost-specific[24m [4mparameters[24m.  These could include such things as the [4mhostname[24m  option,[m
       the  name  of a file to upload (the [4mfilename[24m parameter) and the address of the server from which to upload the[m
       file (the [4mnext-server[24m parameter).  In general, any parameter can appear anywhere that parameters are  allowed,[m
       and will be applied according to the scope in which the parameter appears.[m

       Imagine  that you have a site with a lot of NCD X-Terminals.  These terminals come in a variety of models, and[m
       you want to specify the boot files for each model.  One way to do this would be to have host declarations  for[m
       each server and group them by model:[m
[m
       group {[m
         filename "Xncd19r";[m
         next-server ncd-booter;[m

=======================

Generic options:

/etc/sysconfig/*

   CGROUP_DAEMON=
     List of control groups that the daemon will be run in. For example,
     CGROUP_DAEMON="cpu:daemons cpuacct:/" will run it in the daemons
     group for the CPU controller, and the '/' group for the CPU accounting
     controller.

/etc/sysconfig/authconfig

  used by authconfig to store information about the system's user
  information and authentication setup; changes made to this file
  have no effect until the next time authconfig is run

    USEHESIOD=no
      Whether or not the hesiod naming service is in use.  If not set,
      authconfig examines the passwd setting in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
    USELDAP=no
      Whether or not LDAP is used as a naming service.  If not set,
      authconfig examines the passwd setting in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
    USENIS=no
      Whether or not NIS is in use.  If not set, authconfig examines
      the passwd setting in /etc/nsswitch.conf.

    USEKERBEROS=no
      Whether or not Kerberos is in use.  If not set, authconfig examines
      the settings in /etc/pam.d/system-auth.
    USELDAPAUTH=no
      Whether or not LDAP is being used for authentication.  If not set,
      authconfig examines the settings in /etc/pam.d/system-auth.  Note
      that this option is separate from USELDAP, and that neither implies
      the other.

      If not set, authconfig examines the settings in /etc/pam.d/system-auth.
      This option affects authentication using both local files and LDAP.
    USESHADOW=no
      Whether or not shadow passwords are in use.  If not set, authconfig
      checks for the existence of /etc/shadow.
    USESMBAUTH=no
      Whether or not SMB authentication is in use.  If not set, authconfig
      examines the settings in /etc/pam.d/system-auth.

/etc/sysconfig/autofsck

  does not normally exist; if it does, it can influence a choice
  whether or not to fsck after a crash

    AUTOFSCK_DEF_CHECK=no
      If the user does not respond, choose whether or not to fsck
    AUTOFSCK_SINGLEUSER=
      If this is set, drop to single user mode before fsck.
    
/etc/sysconfig/clock:

  Current releases use the third parameter in the /etc/adjtime
  file (either 'UTC' or 'LOCAL') to determine whether the hwclock
  is in UTC or localtime.
  
  ZONE="filename" indicates the zonefile under /usr/share/zoneinfo
     that /etc/localtime is a copy of, for example:
     ZONE="US/Eastern"

  deprecated values from earlier releases:

    CLOCKMODE=GMT indicates that the clock is set to UTC
    CLOCKMODE=ARC on alpha only indicates the ARC console's
      42-year time offset is in effect
    UTC=true,yes
      Indicates that the hardware clock is set to UTC.
:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K    UTC=no,false
      Indicates that the hardware clock is set to Local Time.
    ARC=true on alpha only indicates the ARC console's
      42-year time offset is in effect; otherwise the normal
      Unix epoch is assumed.
      
    SRM=true on alpha only indicates the SRM 1900 epoch is in
      effect; otherwise the normal Unix epoch is assumed.
    
/etc/sysconfig/init:

  BOOTUP=<some bootup mode>
     BOOTUP=graphical means use X Windows graphical boot up
     BOOTUP=color means colorized text mode boot display. 
     BOOTUP=verbose means old style display
     Anything else means simplified display, but without color or ANSI-formatting
  LOGLEVEL=<a number>
     Sets the initial console logging level for the kernel.
     The default is 7. 8 means everything (including debugging);
     1 means nothing except kernel panics. syslogd will override
     this once it starts.
  RES_COL=<a number>
     Column of the screen to start status labels at. Defaults to 60
  MOVE_TO_COL=<a command>
     A command to move the cursor to $RES_COL. Defaults to nasty
     ANSI sequences output by echo -e.
  SETCOLOR_SUCCESS=<a command>
     A command to set the color to a color indicating success.
     Defaults to nasty ANSI sequences output by echo -e setting
     the color to green.
  SETCOLOR_FAILURE=<a command>
     A command to set the color to a color indicating failure.
     Defaults to nasty ANSI sequences output by echo -e setting
     the color to red.
  SETCOLOR_WARNING=<a command>
     A command to set the color to a color indicating warning.
     Defaults to nasty ANSI sequences output by echo -e setting
:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K     the color to yellow.
  SETCOLOR_NORMAL=<a command>
     A command to set the color to 'normal'. Defaults to nasty
     ANSI sequences output by echo -e.
  PROMPT=yes|no
     Set to 'yes' to enable the key check for interactive mode as well as
     asking if a filesystem check should be done. Default is 'no' and
     the kernel command line option "forcefsck" can be used to check the
     filesystems and "confirm" can be used to enable interactive startup
     questions.

  obsoleted values from earlier releases:

    MAGIC_SYSRQ=yes|no
       Setting this to 'no' used to disable the magic sysrq key and
       Stop-A (break on serial console) on SPARC. This setting has been
       moved into kernel.sysrq and kernel.stop-a settings respectively in
       /etc/sysctl.conf. Setting either of them there to 0 disables it,
       setting it to 1 enables it.
    STOP_A=yes|no
       Setting this to 'no' used to disable the Stop-A (break on
       serial console) key on SPARC.
       This setting has been moved into kernel.stop-a setting in
       /etc/sysctl.conf. Setting it there to 0 disables it,
       setting it to 1 enables it. The setting should be present
       on SPARC only.

/etc/sysconfig/keyboard:

  KEYTABLE=<keytable file>
     for example: KEYTABLE="/usr/lib/kbd/keytables/us.map"
    
     If you dump a keymap (using 'dumpkeys') to
        /etc/sysconfig/console/default.kmap
     it will be loaded on bootup before filesystems are mounted/checked.
     This could be useful if you need to emergency type the root password.
     This has to be a dumped keymap, as opposed to copying the shipped
:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K     keymap files, as the shipped files include other maps from the
     /usr/lib/kbd/keytables directory.
     
  KEYBOARDTYPE=sun|pc
    on SPARC only, sun means a sun keyboard is attached on /dev/kbd,
    pc means a PS/2 keyboard is on ps/2 port.
  
/etc/sysconfig/mouse:

  MOUSETYPE=microsoft|mouseman|mousesystems|ps/2|msbm|logibm|atibm|
    logitech|mmseries|mmhittab
  XEMU3=yes|no (emulate three buttons with two buttons whenever
    necessary, most notably in X)
  DEVICE=<a device node> (the device of the mouse)

  In addition, /dev/mouse points to the mouse device.

/etc/sysconfig/network:

  NETWORKING=yes|no
  GATEWAY=<gateway IP>
  GATEWAYDEV=<gateway device to use, when multiple devices have GATEWAY=> (e.g. eth0)
  NISDOMAIN=<nis domain name>
  NOZEROCONF=
    Set this to not set a route for dynamic link-local addresses.

  NETWORKDELAY=<delay in seconds>
    Delay in seconds after all network interfaces are initialized.  Useful if
    network has spanning tree running and must wait for STP convergence.
    Default: 0 (no delay)


  IPV6FORWARDING=yes|no
    Enable or disable global forwarding of incoming IPv6 packets 
    on all interfaces.
    Note: Actual packet forwarding cannot be controlled per-device, use netfilter6 for such issues
    Default: no
:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K
  IPV6_AUTOCONF=yes|no
    Sets the default for device-based autoconfiguration.
    Default: yes if IPV6FORWARDING=no, no if IPV6FORWARDING=yes
  IPV6_ROUTER=yes|no
    Sets the default for device-based Host/Router behaviour.
    Default: yes if IPV6FORWARDING=yes, no if IPV6FORWARDING=no
  IPV6_AUTOTUNNEL=yes|no
    Controls automatic IPv6 tunneling.
    Default: no

  IPV6_DEFAULTGW=<IPv6 address[%interface]> (optional)
    Add a default route through specified gateway
    An interface can be specified: required for link-local addresses
    Examples:
      IPV6_DEFAULTGW="3ffe:ffff:1234:5678::1"
        Add default route through 3ffe:ffff:1234:5678::1
      IPV6_DEFAULTGW="3ffe:ffff:1234:5678::1%eth0"
        Add default route through 3ffe:ffff:1234:5678::1 and device eth0
      IPV6_DEFAULTGW="fe80::1%eth0"
        Add default route through fe80::1 and device eth0

  Note: if IPV6_DEFAULTGW is specified with %interface scope and it
        doesn't match IPV6_DEFAULTDEV, IPV6_DEFAULTDEV is ignored.
  Note: it's preferred to use %interface for all addresses, not
        just link-local if you have multiple IPv6-enabled interfaces.

  IPV6_DEFAULTDEV=<interface> (optional)
    Add a default route through specified interface without specifying next hop
    Type of interface will be tested whether this is allowed
    Examples:
      IPV6_DEFAULTDEV="eth0" INVALID example!
      IPV6_DEFAULTDEV="ppp0"
      IPV6_DEFAULTDEV="sit1"
    Examples for 6to4
      IPV6_DEFAULTDEV="tun6to4"
        Add default route through dedicated 6to4 tunnel device "tun6to4", if configured
:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K
  Note: "tun6to4" does not support an additional IPV6_DEFAULTGW.
        Other interfaces prefer IPV6_DEFAULTGW, if specified.

  IPV6_RADVD_PIDFILE=<pid-file> (optional)
    Location of PID file for controlling radvd, see IPV6_CONTROL_RADVD
    Default: "/var/run/radvd/radvd.pid"
    Example:
       IPV6_RADVD_PIDFILE="/some/other/location/radvd.pid"
  IPV6TO4_RADVD_PIDFILE=<pid-file> (obsolete)
    As above, still supported for a while for backward compatibility.
  IPV6_RADVD_TRIGGER_ACTION=startstop|reload|restart|SIGHUP (optional)
    How to trigger radvd in case of 6to4 or PPP action
     startstop: radvd starts if interface goes up and stops
       if interface goes down using initscript call of radvd with related parameter
     reload|restart: initscript of radvd is called with this parameter
     SIGHUP: signal HUP is sent to radvd, pidfile must be specified, if not the default
    Default: SIGHUP

  IPv6 options above can be overridden in interface-specific configuration.

  obsoleted values from earlier releases:

    FORWARD_IPV4=yes|no
      This setting has been moved into net.ipv4.ip_forward setting
      in /etc/sysctl.conf. Setting it to 1 there enables IP forwarding,
      setting it to 0 disables it (which is the default for RFC compliance).

    NETWORKWAIT=yes|no
      This is not used with the move to systemd.

    HOSTNAME=<fqdn by default, but whatever hostname you want>
      This is now configured in /etc/hostname.

/etc/sysconfig/static-routes-ipv6:
  Contains lines of the form:

:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K    <device> IPv6-network IPv6-gateway
    <tunneldevice> IPv6-network

  <device> must be a device name to have the route brought up and
  down with the device

  For example:
  
  eth0   fec0:0:0:2::/64                         fec0:0:0:1:0:0:0:20
   adds a route for IPv6 network fec0:0:0:2::/64 through fec0:0:0:1:0:0:0:20
   
  eth0    2000::/3                               3ffe:ffff:0:1::1
   so-called "default" routes for clients

  sit1    2000::/3
   adds routes through dedicated tunnel interface sit1

  tun6to4  3ffe:ffff:1234::/56                  
   adds routes through hardwired 6to4 tunnel interface tun6to4
  tun6to4  3ffe:ffff:5678::/56                  ::5.6.7.8
   adds routes through hardwired 6to4 tunnel interface tun6to4,
   specifying next hop   

  Notes:
    * default routes (such as the "2000::/3" shown above) should be set with
       IPV6_DEFAULTGW and IPV6_DEFAULTDEV, see more above.
    * tunnel device "sit0" is not supported here, routes will never be applied

/etc/sysconfig/routed:

  SILENT=yes|no

/etc/sysconfig/tape:

  DEV=/dev/nst0
    Tape device.  Use the non-rewinding one for these scripts.
  
    For SCSI tapes this is /dev/nst#, where # is the number of the
    tape drive you want to use.  If you only have one then use
    nst0.
 
    For IDE tapes you use /dev/ht#, where # is the number of the tape
    drive you want to use (usually ht0).
 
    For floppy tape drives use /dev/ftape.

    Person to mail to if the backup fails for any reason

:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K  SLEEP=5
    Time to sleep between tape operations.  Some drives need a bit
    more than others, but 5 seems to work for 8mm, 4mm, and DLT

  BLOCKSIZE=32768
    This worked fine for 8mm, then 4mm, and now DLT.  An optimal
    setting is probably however much data your drive writes at one
    time.

  SHORTDATE=$(date +%y:%m:%d:%H:%M)
    A short date string, used in backup log filenames.

  DAY=$(date +log-%y:%m:%d)

Files in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
========================================

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup:
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifdown:

  Symlinks to /sbin/ifup and /sbin/ifdown, respectively.
  These are the only two scripts "in" this directory that should
  be called directly; these two scripts call all the other
  scripts as needed.  These symlinks are here for legacy purposes --
  only /sbin/ifup and /sbin/ifdown should currently be used
  at the user level.

  These scripts take one argument normally: the name of the device
  (e.g. eth0).  They are called with a second argument of "boot"
  during the boot sequence so that devices that are not meant to
:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K  be brought up on boot (ONBOOT=no, see below) can be ignored at
  that time.

  Also, interfaces may be brought up via the hotplug scripts;
  in this case, HOTPLUG=no needs to be set to no to avoid this.
  This is useful e.g. to prevent bonding device activation by merely
  loading the bonding kernel module.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/init.ipv6-global:
  Not really a public file.  Contains different basic settings that
  are set from /etc/[rc.d]/init.d/network at different stages of
  network initialization.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/network-functions:

  Not really a public file.  Contains functions which the scripts use
  for bringing interfaces up and down.  In particular, it contains
  most of the code for handling alternative interface configurations
  and interface change notification through netreport.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/network-functions-ipv6:

  Not really a public file.  Contains functions which the scripts use
  for bringing IPv6 on interfaces up and down, like addresses, routes,
  forwarding handling and static or automatic tunneling.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface-name> and
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface-name>:<alias-name>:

  The first defines an interface, and the second contains
  only the parts of the definition that are different in a
  "alias" (or alternative) interface.  For example, the
  network numbers might be different, but everything else
  might be the same, so only the network numbers would be
  in the alias file, but all the device information would
  be in the base ifcfg file.

:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K  The items that can be defined in an ifcfg file depend on the
  interface type.  The really obvious ones I'm not going to
  bother to define; you can figure out what "IPADDR" is, I
  think...  :-)

  Base items:
    NAME=<friendly name for users to see>
      Most important for PPP.  Only used in front ends.
    DEVICE=<name of physical device (except dynamically-allocated PPP
      devices where it is the "logical name")>
    IPADDRn=
    PREFIXn=
      Network prefix.  It is used for all configurations except aliases
      and ippp devices.  It takes precedence over NETMASK when both
      PREFIX and NETMASK are set.
    NETMASKn=
      Subnet mask; just useful for aliases and ippp devices.  For all other
      configurations, use PREFIX instead.

    The "n" is expected to be consecutive positive integers starting from 0.
    It can be omitted if there is only one address being configured.

    GATEWAY=
    METRIC=
      Metric for the default route using GATEWAY
    ONBOOT=yes|no (not valid for alias devices; use ONPARENT)
    HOTPLUG=yes|no
    USERCTL=yes|no
    BOOTPROTO=none|bootp|dhcp
      'bootp' or 'dhcp' cause a DHCP client to run on the device. Any other
      value causes any static configuration in the file to be applied.
    VLAN=yes|no
    MTU=
      Default MTU for this device
    WINDOW=
      Default window for routes from this device
    PEERDNS=yes|no
:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K      modify /etc/resolv.conf if peer uses msdns extension (PPP only) or
      DNS{1,2} are set, or if using dhclient. default to "yes".
    DNS{1,2}=<ip address>
      provide DNS addresses that are dropped into the resolv.conf
      file if PEERDNS is not set to "no".
    SCOPE=
      Set to "scope SCOPE-ID" to set a non-default scope for a statically
      configured IP address.
    SRCADDR=
      use the specified source address for outgoing packets
    HWADDR=
      ethernet hardware address for this device
    MACADDR=
      Set the hardware address for this device to this.
      Use of this in conjunction with HWADDR= may cause
      unintended behavior.
    NOZEROCONF=
      Set this to not set a route for dynamic link-local addresses
      over this device.
    PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes|no|1|0
      Without this option, or if it is 'no'/'0', and BOOTPROTO=dhcp,
      dhclient is run for the interface in "one-shot" mode; if the 
      dhcp server does not respond for a configurable timeout, then
      dhclient exits and the interface is not brought up - 
      the '-1' option is given to dhclient.
      If PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes, then dhclient will keep on trying
      to contact the dhcp server when it does not respond - no '-1'
      option is given to dhclient. Note: this disables the automatic
      checking for the presence of a link before starting dhclient.
    DHCPRELEASE=yes|no|1|0
      With this option set to 'yes' (1), when a dhcp configured
      interface is brought down with 'ifdown', the lease will be
      released. Otherwise, leases are not released.

    NO_DHCP_HOSTNAME=yes|no|1|0
      Tells initscripts to not obtain hostname from DHCP server in the ifup-post
      phase. This option might be useful especially with static configuration of
:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K      the interface.
    DHCP_SEND_HOSTNAME=yes|no|1|0
      Tells initscripts whether the DHCP_HOSTNAME or DHCP_FQDN options (below)
      should be sent to DHCP server.
    DHCP_HOSTNAME=<hostname>
      Sends the specified hostname to the DHCP server.
    DHCP_FQDN=<fully.qualified.domain.name>
      Sends the specified FQDN to the DHCP server.

    Please note when both DHCP_HOSTNAME and DHCP_FQDN are specified,
    only DHCP_FQDN will be used. (Same behaviour as with NetworkManager.)

    DHCLIENT_IGNORE_GATEWAY=yes|no|1|0
      If set to 'yes', it will cause dhclient-script to ignore any $GATEWAY
      setting that may be in the ifcfg file for this interface.
      Otherwise, the dhclient session which obtains an ip-address
      on the same subnet as $GATEWAY will set the default route
      to be via $GATEWAY, and no other dhclient session will set
      the default route.
    DHCLIENTARGS=
      Any additional arguments to dhclient.
    NM_CONTROLLED=yes|no
      If set to 'no', NetworkManager will ignore this connection/device.
      Defaults to 'yes'.
    ZONE=
      Network zone (trust level) of this connection.
      If not set, default zone (specified in /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf)
      is used. To see all available zones, run 'firewall-cmd --get-zones'.
    ARPCHECKn=yes|no
      If set to 'no', ifup will not try to determine, if requested ip address
      is used by other machine in network.
      Defaults to 'yes'.
    IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=yes|no
      If set to yes, ifup-eth will end immediately after ipv4 dhclient fails.
      Defaults to 'no'.

  For dynamic addressing (BOOTPROTO=dhcp) only DEVICE needs to
:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K  be set; all the rest will be determined by the boot protocol.

   IPv6-only option to enable DHCPv6 client:
      DHCPV6C=yes|no
      This will enable the DHCPv6 features of dhclient to be run for the interface.
      See man dhclient(8) and dhclient.conf(5).
      DHCPV6C_OPTIONS=...
      This will pass given arguments to the DHCPv6 client.  For example,
      "-S" option will request network information (e.g., DNS addresses)
      only, not IPv6 addresses.

  Ethernet-only items:
    ARP=yes|no (adds 'arp' flag to ip, for use with the
      ethertap device)
    LINKDELAY=<time in seconds>
      Time that the system should pause after the specific interface is
:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K      enabled.  This may be useful if one interface is connected to a
      switch which has spanning tree enabled and must wait for STP to
      converge before the interface should be considered usable.
    BRIDGE=<br* device>
      If set, the ethernet device is not assigned an address.  It is added to
      the specified bridge device instead.

   Deprecated, but supported:
    ETHTOOL_OPTS=...
      Any device-specific options supported by ethtool. For example,
      if you wanted to force 100Mb full duplex:
        ETHTOOL_OPTS="speed 100 duplex full autoneg off"
      Note that changing speed or duplex settings almost always
      requires disabling autonegotiation with 'autoneg off'.

      Multiple options can also be set like so :
      ETHTOOL_OPTS="-K ${DEVICE} tso on; -G ${DEVICE} rx 256 tx 256"

      Long term, this should be done by sysadmin-written udev rules.

    No longer supported:
     PROMISC=yes|no (enable or disable promiscuous mode)
     ALLMULTI=yes|no (enable or disable all-multicast mode)
     
     To properly set these, use the packet socket interface.

  Ethernet 802.1q VLAN items:
     DEVICE=eth0.42
       Initscripts use the device name for VLAN devices.
               Example: eth0.42 for vlan 42 on device eth0.
       Valid VLAN ID range is 0-4095. Most ethernet switches reserve
       VLAN ID 1 to be used as management VLAN; starting from VLAN
       ID 2 is recommended.
     REORDER_HDR=yes|no
       When enabled the VLAN device will move the ethernet header
       around to make it look exactly like a real ethernet device.
       This may help programs such as ISC dhcpd which read the raw
:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K       ethernet packet and make assumptions about the location of
       bytes. If you don't need it turn it off because there
       is a small performance penalty. Default is on.

  PPP-specific items
    WVDIALSECT=<list of sections from wvdial.conf to use>
      If this variable is set, then the chat script (if it
      exists) is ignored, and wvdial is used to open the
      PPP connection.
    DEFROUTE=yes|no (set this interface as default route? yes is default)
    DEBUG=yes|no (defaults to yes)
      turns on/off pppd and chat (if used) debugging.
    ESCAPECHARS=yes|no (simplified interface here doesn't let people
      specify which characters to escape; almost everyone can use
      asyncmap 00000000 anyway, and they can set PPPOPTIONS to
      asyncmap foobar if they want to set options perfectly)
    HARDFLOWCTL=yes|no (yes implies "modem crtscts" options)
    PPPOPTIONS=<arbitrary option string; is placed last on the
      command line, so it can override other options like asyncmap
      that were specified differently>
    PPPOE_EXTRA = any extra arguments to pass to pppoe 
    PPPD_EXTRA =  any extra arguments to pass to pppd 
    PAPNAME=<"name $PAPNAME" on pppd command line> (note that
      the "remotename" option is always specified as the logical
      ppp device name, like "ppp0" (which might perhaps be the
:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K      physical device ppp1 if some other ppp device was brought
      up earlier...), which makes it easy to manage pap/chap
      files -- name/password pairs are associated with the
      logical ppp device name so that they can be managed
      together.
    REMIP=<remote ip address, normally unspecified>
    MTU=

    DISCONNECTTIMEOUT=<number of seconds, default currently 5>
      (time to wait before re-establishing the connection after

      to establish a new connection.)
    RETRYTIMEOUT=<number of seconds, default currently 60>
      (time to wait before re-attempting to establish a connection
      after a previous attempt fails.)
    RETRYCONNECT=yes|no (defaults to yes)
      If this is yes, then we will re-run pppd if it exits with a 
      "connect script failed" status.  Otherwise, only one attempt
      is made to bring up the connection.  Note that some connect
      scripts (for example, wvdial) might do their own retries (such
      as BUSY or NO DIALTONE conditions).
    MAXFAIL=<number>
      If this is set, this will cause ppp-watch to exit after
      the specified number of attempts.
    DEMAND=yes|no
      Switches on demand-dialing mode using pppd's "demand" option.
    IDLETIMEOUT=600
      The amount of time the link needs to be inactive before pppd will
      bring it down automatically.
    BOOTTIMEOUT=30
      The amount of time to wait at boot before giving up on the
      connection.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-post

  Called when any network device EXCEPT a SLIP device comes

  bring up static routes that depend on that device.  Calls
  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-aliases to bring up
  aliases for that device.  Sets the hostname if it is not
  already set and a hostname can be found for the IP for that
  device.  Sends SIGIO to any programs that have requested
  notification of network events.

  Could be extended to fix up nameservice configuration, call
  arbitrary scripts, etc, as needed.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-routes

  Set up static routes for a device.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-aliases

  Bring up aliases for a device.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-<interface-name>

  Contains lines that specify additional routes that should be added when the
  associated interface is brought up.

  The files are processed by the ifup-routes script and uses the /sbin/ipcalc
  utility for all network masks and numbers. Routes are specified using the
  syntax:

    ADDRESSn=<network>
    NETMASKn=<network/prefix mask>
    GATEWAYn=<next-hop router/gateway IP address>
:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K
  The "n" is expected to be consecutive positive integers starting from 0.
  For example:

    ADDRESS0=192.168.2.0
    NETMASK0=255.255.255.0
    GATEWAY0=192.168.1.1

  adds a network route to the 192.168.2.0 network via the gateway at
  192.168.1.1. Since you must already have a route to the network of the
  gateway, there is no need to specify a device.

  Note: The ifup-routes script also supports an older syntax designed to be
  used directly as an argument to "/sbin/ip route add".
  If no "ADDRESSn" lines are found the following will still
  work:
  
  192.168.2.0/24 dev ppp0
  
  adds a network route to the 192.168.2.0 network through ppp0.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route6-<interface-name>

  Contains lines that are arguments to "/sbin/ip -6 route add"
  For example:

  site-local route for network fec0:0:0:2::/64
   via gateway fec0:0:0:1:0:0:0:20 (e.g. on eth0): 

  fec0:0:0:2::/64 via fec0:0:0:1:0:0:0:20

  additional prefix configured to be on-link on eth0:

  3ffe:fffe:1:2::/64 dev eth0
  
  6to4 route for network 3ffe:ffff:1::/48, either:

:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K  3ffe:ffff:1::/48
  3ffe:ffff:1::/48 via ::192.168.1.2

  Note the special case of 6to4 interface: 'via [relay]' is 
  automatically added if explicit 'via' wasn't specified.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/rule-<interface-name>
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/rule6-<interface-name>

  Contains lines that specify additional routing rules that should be added
  when the associated interface is brought up.

  Each non-comment line is used directly as an argument to "/sbin/ip rule add"
  or "/sbin/ip -6 rule add" for rule6 files.

  IPV6_DEFAULTGW=<IPv6 address[%interface]> (optional)
    Add a default route through specified gateway
    An interface can be specified: required for link-local addresses
    Examples:

      IPV6_DEFAULTGW="fe80::1%eth0"
        Add default route through fe80::1 and device eth0

  Note: if IPV6_DEFAULTGW is specified with %interface scope and it
        doesn't match IPV6_DEFAULTDEV, IPV6_DEFAULTDEV is ignored.
  Note: it's preferred to use %interface for all addresses, not
        just link-local if you have multiple IPv6-enabled interfaces.

  IPV6_DEFAULTDEV=<interface> (optional)
    Add a default route through specified interface without specifying next hop
    Type of interface will be tested whether this is allowed
    Examples:
      IPV6_DEFAULTDEV="eth0" INVALID example!
      IPV6_DEFAULTDEV="ppp0"

  IPV6_RADVD_PIDFILE=<pid-file> (optional)
    Location of PID file for controlling radvd, see IPV6_CONTROL_RADVD
    Default: "/var/run/radvd/radvd.pid"
    Example:
       IPV6_RADVD_PIDFILE="/some/other/location/radvd.pid"
  IPV6TO4_RADVD_PIDFILE=<pid-file> (obsolete)
    As above, still supported for a while for backward compatibility.
  IPV6_RADVD_TRIGGER_ACTION=startstop|reload|restart|SIGHUP (optional)
    How to trigger radvd in case of 6to4 or PPP action
     startstop: radvd starts if interface goes up and stops
       if interface goes down using initscript call of radvd with related parameter
     reload|restart: initscript of radvd is called with this parameter
     SIGHUP: signal HUP is sent to radvd, pidfile must be specified, if not the default
    Default: SIGHUP

  IPv6 options above can be overridden in interface-specific configuration.

  obsoleted values from earlier releases:

    FORWARD_IPV4=yes|no
      This setting has been moved into net.ipv4.ip_forward setting
      in /etc/sysctl.conf. Setting it to 1 there enables IP forwarding,
      setting it to 0 disables it (which is the default for RFC compliance).

    NETWORKWAIT=yes|no
      This is not used with the move to systemd.

Files in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
========================================

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup:
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifdown:

  Symlinks to /sbin/ifup and /sbin/ifdown, respectively.
  These are the only two scripts "in" this directory that should
  be called directly; these two scripts call all the other
  scripts as needed.  These symlinks are here for legacy purposes --
  only /sbin/ifup and /sbin/ifdown should currently be used
  at the user level.

  These scripts take one argument normally: the name of the device
  (e.g. eth0).  They are called with a second argument of "boot"
:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K  during the boot sequence so that devices that are not meant to
  be brought up on boot (ONBOOT=no, see below) can be ignored at
  that time.

  Also, interfaces may be brought up via the hotplug scripts;
  in this case, HOTPLUG=no needs to be set to no to avoid this.
  This is useful e.g. to prevent bonding device activation by merely
  loading the bonding kernel module.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/init.ipv6-global:
  Not really a public file.  Contains different basic settings that
  are set from /etc/[rc.d]/init.d/network at different stages of
  network initialization.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/network-functions:

  Not really a public file.  Contains functions which the scripts use
  for bringing interfaces up and down.  In particular, it contains
  most of the code for handling alternative interface configurations
  and interface change notification through netreport.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/network-functions-ipv6:

  Not really a public file.  Contains functions which the scripts use
  for bringing IPv6 on interfaces up and down, like addresses, routes,
  forwarding handling and static or automatic tunneling.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface-name> and
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface-name>:<alias-name>:

  The first defines an interface, and the second contains
  only the parts of the definition that are different in a
  "alias" (or alternative) interface.  For example, the
  network numbers might be different, but everything else
  might be the same, so only the network numbers would be
  in the alias file, but all the device information would
  be in the base ifcfg file.
:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K
  The items that can be defined in an ifcfg file depend on the
  interface type.  The really obvious ones I'm not going to
  bother to define; you can figure out what "IPADDR" is, I
  think...  :-)

  Base items:
    NAME=<friendly name for users to see>
      Most important for PPP.  Only used in front ends.
    DEVICE=<name of physical device (except dynamically-allocated PPP
      devices where it is the "logical name")>
    IPADDRn=
    PREFIXn=
      Network prefix.  It is used for all configurations except aliases
      and ippp devices.  It takes precedence over NETMASK when both
      PREFIX and NETMASK are set.
    NETMASKn=
      Subnet mask; just useful for aliases and ippp devices.  For all other
      configurations, use PREFIX instead.

    The "n" is expected to be consecutive positive integers starting from 0.
    It can be omitted if there is only one address being configured.

    GATEWAY=
    METRIC=
      Metric for the default route using GATEWAY
    ONBOOT=yes|no (not valid for alias devices; use ONPARENT)
    HOTPLUG=yes|no
    USERCTL=yes|no
    BOOTPROTO=none|bootp|dhcp
      'bootp' or 'dhcp' cause a DHCP client to run on the device. Any other
      value causes any static configuration in the file to be applied.
    VLAN=yes|no
    MTU=
      Default MTU for this device

    DNS{1,2}=<ip address>
      provide DNS addresses that are dropped into the resolv.conf
      file if PEERDNS is not set to "no".
    SCOPE=
      Set to "scope SCOPE-ID" to set a non-default scope for a statically
      configured IP address.
    SRCADDR=
      use the specified source address for outgoing packets
    HWADDR=
      ethernet hardware address for this device
    MACADDR=

      unintended behavior.
    NOZEROCONF=
      Set this to not set a route for dynamic link-local addresses

    PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes|no|1|0
      Without this option, or if it is 'no'/'0', and BOOTPROTO=dhcp,
      dhclient is run for the interface in "one-shot" mode; if the 
      dhcp server does not respond for a configurable timeout, then
      dhclient exits and the interface is not brought up - 
      the '-1' option is given to dhclient.
      If PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes, then dhclient will keep on trying
      to contact the dhcp server when it does not respond - no '-1'
      option is given to dhclient. Note: this disables the automatic
      checking for the presence of a link before starting dhclient.
    DHCPRELEASE=yes|no|1|0
      With this option set to 'yes' (1), when a dhcp configured
      interface is brought down with 'ifdown', the lease will be
      released. Otherwise, leases are not released.

    NO_DHCP_HOSTNAME=yes|no|1|0

      Tells initscripts whether the DHCP_HOSTNAME or DHCP_FQDN options (below)
      should be sent to DHCP server.
    DHCP_HOSTNAME=<hostname>
      Sends the specified hostname to the DHCP server.
    DHCP_FQDN=<fully.qualified.domain.name>
      Sends the specified FQDN to the DHCP server.

    Please note when both DHCP_HOSTNAME and DHCP_FQDN are specified,
    only DHCP_FQDN will be used. (Same behaviour as with NetworkManager.)

    DHCLIENT_IGNORE_GATEWAY=yes|no|1|0
      If set to 'yes', it will cause dhclient-script to ignore any $GATEWAY
      setting that may be in the ifcfg file for this interface.
      Otherwise, the dhclient session which obtains an ip-address
      on the same subnet as $GATEWAY will set the default route
      to be via $GATEWAY, and no other dhclient session will set
      the default route.
    DHCLIENTARGS=
      Any additional arguments to dhclient.
    NM_CONTROLLED=yes|no
      If set to 'no', NetworkManager will ignore this connection/device.
      Defaults to 'yes'.
    ZONE=
      Network zone (trust level) of this connection.
      If not set, default zone (specified in /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf)
      is used. To see all available zones, run 'firewall-cmd --get-zones'.
    ARPCHECKn=yes|no
      If set to 'no', ifup will not try to determine, if requested ip address
      is used by other machine in network.
      Defaults to 'yes'.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-post

  Called when any network device EXCEPT a SLIP device comes

  bring up static routes that depend on that device.  Calls
  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-aliases to bring up
  aliases for that device.  Sets the hostname if it is not
  already set and a hostname can be found for the IP for that
  device.  Sends SIGIO to any programs that have requested
  notification of network events.

  Could be extended to fix up nameservice configuration, call
  arbitrary scripts, etc, as needed.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-routes

  Set up static routes for a device.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-aliases

  Bring up aliases for a device.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-<interface-name>

  Contains lines that specify additional routes that should be added when the
  associated interface is brought up.

  The files are processed by the ifup-routes script and uses the /sbin/ipcalc
  utility for all network masks and numbers. Routes are specified using the
  syntax:

    ADDRESSn=<network>
    NETMASKn=<network/prefix mask>
:[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K    GATEWAYn=<next-hop router/gateway IP address>

  The "n" is expected to be consecutive positive integers starting from 0.
  For example:

    ADDRESS0=192.168.2.0
    NETMASK0=255.255.255.0
    GATEWAY0=192.168.1.1

  adds a network route to the 192.168.2.0 network via the gateway at
  192.168.1.1. Since you must already have a route to the network of the
  gateway, there is no need to specify a device.

  Note: The ifup-routes script also supports an older syntax designed to be
  used directly as an argument to "/sbin/ip route add".
  If no "ADDRESSn" lines are found the following will still
  work:
  
  192.168.2.0/24 dev ppp0
  
  adds a network route to the 192.168.2.0 network through ppp0.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route6-<interface-name>

  Contains lines that are arguments to "/sbin/ip -6 route add"
  For example:

  site-local route for network fec0:0:0:2::/64
   via gateway fec0:0:0:1:0:0:0:20 (e.g. on eth0): 

  fec0:0:0:2::/64 via fec0:0:0:1:0:0:0:20

  additional prefix configured to be on-link on eth0:

  3ffe:fffe:1:2::/64 dev eth0

  Note the special case of 6to4 interface: 'via [relay]' is 
  automatically added if explicit 'via' wasn't specified.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/rule-<interface-name>
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/rule6-<interface-name>

  Contains lines that specify additional routing rules that should be added
  when the associated interface is brought up.

  Each non-comment line is used directly as an argument to "/sbin/ip rule add"
  or "/sbin/ip -6 rule add" for rule6 files.

Files in /etc/sysconfig/[7mnetwork[27m-scripts/
========================================

/etc/sysconfig/[7mnetwork[27m-scripts/ifup:
/etc/sysconfig/[7mnetwork[27m-scripts/ifdown:

  Symlinks to /sbin/ifup and /sbin/ifdown, respectively.
  These are the only two scripts "in" this directory that should
  be called directly; these two scripts call all the other
  scripts as needed.  These symlinks are here for legacy purposes --
  only /sbin/ifup and /sbin/ifdown should currently be used
  at the user level.

  These scripts take one argument normally: the name of the device
  (e.g. eth0).  They are called with a second argument of "boot"
  during the boot sequence so that devices that are not meant to
  be brought up on boot (ONBOOT=no, see below) can be ignored at
  that time.

  Also, interfaces may be brought up via the hotplug scripts;
  in this case, HOTPLUG=no needs to be set to no to avoid this.
  This is useful e.g. to prevent bonding device activation by merely
  loading the bonding kernel module.

/etc/sysconfig/[7mnetwork[27m-scripts/init.ipv6-global:
  Not really a public file.  Contains different basic settings that
  are set from /etc/[rc.d]/init.d/[7mnetwork[27m at different stages of
  [7mnetwork[27m initialization.

/etc/sysconfig/[7mnetwork[27m-scripts/[7mnetwork[27m-functions:

  Not really a public file.  Contains functions which the scripts use
  for bringing interfaces up and down.  In particular, it contains
  most of the code for handling alternative interface configurations
  and interface change notification through netreport.

      setting that may be in the ifcfg file for this interface.
      Otherwise, the dhclient session which obtains an ip-address

Generic options:

/etc/sysconfig/*

   CGROUP_DAEMON=
     List of control groups that the daemon will be run in. For example,
     CGROUP_DAEMON="cpu:daemons cpuacct:/" will run it in the daemons
     group for the CPU controller, and the '/' group for the CPU accounting
     controller.

/etc/sysconfig/authconfig

  used by authconfig to store information about the system's user
  information and authentication setup; changes made to this file
  have no effect until the next time authconfig is run

    USEHESIOD=no
      Whether or not the hesiod naming service is in use.  If not set,
      authconfig examines the passwd setting in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
    USELDAP=no
      Whether or not LDAP is used as a naming service.  If not set,
      authconfig examines the passwd setting in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
    USENIS=no
      Whether or not NIS is in use.  If not set, authconfig examines
      the passwd setting in /etc/nsswitch.conf.

    USEKERBEROS=no
      Whether or not Kerberos is in use.  If not set, authconfig examines
      the settings in /etc/pam.d/system-auth.
    USELDAPAUTH=no
      Whether or not LDAP is being used for authentication.  If not set,
      authconfig examines the settings in /etc/pam.d/system-auth.  Note
      that this option is separate from USELDAP, and that neither implies
      the other.

      Whether or not MD5-based hashing should be used when setting passwords.
      If not set, authconfig examines the settings in /etc/pam.d/system-auth.
      This option affects authentication using both local files and LDAP.
    USESHADOW=no
      Whether or not shadow passwords are in use.  If not set, authconfig
      checks for the existence of /etc/shadow.
    USESMBAUTH=no
      Whether or not SMB authentication is in use.  If not set, authconfig
      examines the settings in /etc/pam.d/system-auth.

/etc/sysconfig/autofsck

  does not normally exist; if it does, it can influence a choice
  whether or not to fsck after a crash

    AUTOFSCK_DEF_CHECK=no
      If the user does not respond, choose whether or not to fsck
    AUTOFSCK_SINGLEUSER=
      If this is set, drop to single user mode before fsck.
    
/etc/sysconfig/clock:

  Current releases use the third parameter in the /etc/adjtime
  file (either 'UTC' or 'LOCAL') to determine whether the hwclock
  is in UTC or localtime.
  
  ZONE="filename" indicates the zonefile under /usr/share/zoneinfo
     that /etc/localtime is a copy of, for example:
     ZONE="US/Eastern"

  deprecated values from earlier releases:

    CLOCKMODE=GMT indicates that the clock is set to UTC
    CLOCKMODE=ARC on alpha only indicates the ARC console's
      42-year time offset is in effect
    UTC=true,yes

Files in /etc/sysconfig/[7mnetwork-scripts[27m/
========================================

/etc/sysconfig/[7mnetwork-scripts[27m/ifup:
/etc/sysconfig/[7mnetwork-scripts[27m/ifdown:

  Symlinks to /sbin/ifup and /sbin/ifdown, respectively.
  These are the only two scripts "in" this directory that should
  be called directly; these two scripts call all the other
  scripts as needed.  These symlinks are here for legacy purposes --
  only /sbin/ifup and /sbin/ifdown should currently be used
  at the user level.

  These scripts take one argument normally: the name of the device
  (e.g. eth0).  They are called with a second argument of "boot"
  during the boot sequence so that devices that are not meant to
  be brought up on boot (ONBOOT=no, see below) can be ignored at
  that time.

  Also, interfaces may be brought up via the hotplug scripts;
  in this case, HOTPLUG=no needs to be set to no to avoid this.
  This is useful e.g. to prevent bonding device activation by merely
  loading the bonding kernel module.

/etc/sysconfig/[7mnetwork-scripts[27m/init.ipv6-global:
  Not really a public file.  Contains different basic settings that
  are set from /etc/[rc.d]/init.d/network at different stages of
  network initialization.

/etc/sysconfig/[7mnetwork-scripts[27m/network-functions:

  Not really a public file.  Contains functions which the scripts use
  for bringing interfaces up and down.  In particular, it contains
  most of the code for handling alternative interface configurations
  and interface change notification through netreport.

    SCOPE=
      Set to "scope SCOPE-ID" to set a non-default scope for a statically

    SRCADDR=
      use the specified source address for outgoing packets
    HWADDR=
      ethernet hardware address for this device
    MACADDR=
      Set the hardware address for this device to this.
      Use of this in conjunction with HWADDR= may cause
      unintended behavior.
    NOZEROCONF=
      Set this to not set a route for dynamic link-local addresses

    PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes|no|1|0
      Without this option, or if it is 'no'/'0', and BOOTPROTO=dhcp,
      dhclient is run for the interface in "one-shot" mode; if the 
      dhcp server does not respond for a configurable timeout, then

      the '-1' option is given to dhclient.
      If PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes, then dhclient will keep on trying
      to contact the dhcp server when it does not respond - no '-1'
      option is given to dhclient. Note: this disables the automatic
      checking for the presence of a link before starting dhclient.
    DHCPRELEASE=yes|no|1|0
      With this option set to 'yes' (1), when a dhcp configured
      interface is brought down with 'ifdown', the lease will be
      released. Otherwise, leases are not released.

    NO_DHCP_HOSTNAME=yes|no|1|0
      Tells initscripts to not obtain hostname from DHCP server in the ifup-post
      phase. This option might be useful especially with static configuration of
      the interface.
    DHCP_SEND_HOSTNAME=yes|no|1|0

       Valid VLAN ID range is 0-4095. Most ethernet switches reserve

  syntax:

    ADDRESSn=<network>
    NETMASKn=<network/prefix mask>
    GATEWAYn=<next-hop router/gateway IP address>

  The "n" is expected to be consecutive positive integers starting from 0.

  adds a network route to the 192.168.2.0 network via the gateway at
  192.168.1.1. Since you must already have a route to the network of the
  gateway, there is no need to specify a device.

  Note: The ifup-routes script also supports an older syntax designed to be
  used directly as an argument to "/sbin/ip route add".

Generic options:

/etc/sysconfig/*

   CGROUP_DAEMON=
     List of control groups that the daemon will be run in. For example,
     CGROUP_DAEMON="cpu:daemons cpuacct:/" will run it in the daemons
     group for the CPU controller, and the '/' group for the CPU accounting
     controller.

/etc/sysconfig/authconfig

  used by authconfig to store information about the system's user
  information and authentication setup; changes made to this file
  have no effect until the next time authconfig is run

    USEHESIOD=no
      Whether or not the hesiod naming service is in use.  If not set,
      authconfig examines the passwd setting in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
    USELDAP=no
      Whether or not LDAP is used as a naming service.  If not set,
      authconfig examines the passwd setting in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
    USENIS=no
      Whether or not NIS is in use.  If not set, authconfig examines
      the passwd setting in /etc/nsswitch.conf.

    USEKERBEROS=no
      Whether or not Kerberos is in use.  If not set, authconfig examines
      the settings in /etc/pam.d/system-auth.
    USELDAPAUTH=no
      Whether or not LDAP is being used for authentication.  If not set,
      authconfig examines the settings in /etc/pam.d/system-auth.  Note
      that this option is separate from USELDAP, and that neither implies
      the other.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-<interface-name>

  Contains lines that specify additional routes that should be added when the
  associated interface is brought up.

  The files are processed by the ifup-routes script and uses the /sbin/ipcalc
  utility for all network masks and numbers. Routes are specified using the
  syntax:

    ADDRESSn=<network>
    NETMASKn=<network/prefix mask>
    GATEWAYn=<next-hop router/gateway IP address>

  The "n" is expected to be consecutive positive integers starting from 0.
  For example:

    ADDRESS0=192.168.2.0
    NETMASK0=255.255.255.0
    GATEWAY0=192.168.1.1

  adds a network route to the 192.168.2.0 network via the gateway at
  192.168.1.1. Since you must already have a route to the network of the
  gateway, there is no need to specify a device.

  Note: The ifup-routes script also supports an older syntax designed to be
  used directly as an argument to "/sbin/ip route add".
  If no "ADDRESSn" lines are found the following will still
  work:

      Network prefix.  It is used for all configurations except aliases
      and ippp devices.  It takes precedence over NETMASK when both
      PREFIX and NETMASK are set.
    NETMASKn=
      Subnet mask; just useful for aliases and ippp devices.  For all other
      configurations, use PREFIX instead.

    The "n" is expected to be consecutive positive integers starting from 0.
    It can be omitted if there is only one address being configured.

    GATEWAY=
    METRIC=
:[K[K/[K...skipping...
      value causes any [7mstatic[27m configuration in the file to be applied.
    VLAN=yes|no
    MTU=
      Default MTU for this device
    WINDOW=
      Default window for routes from this device
    PEERDNS=yes|no
      modify /etc/resolv.conf if peer uses msdns extension (PPP only) or
      DNS{1,2} are set, or if using dhclient. default to "yes".
    DNS{1,2}=<ip address>
      provide DNS addresses that are dropped into the resolv.conf
      file if PEERDNS is not set to "no".
    SCOPE=
      Set to "scope SCOPE-ID" to set a non-default scope for a [7mstatic[27mally
      configured IP address.
    SRCADDR=
      use the specified source address for outgoing packets
    HWADDR=
      ethernet hardware address for this device
    MACADDR=
      Set the hardware address for this device to this.
      Use of this in conjunction with HWADDR= may cause
      unintended behavior.
    NOZEROCONF=
      Set this to not set a route for dynamic link-local addresses
      over this device.
    PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes|no|1|0
      Without this option, or if it is 'no'/'0', and BOOTPROTO=dhcp,
      dhclient is run for the interface in "one-shot" mode; if the 
      dhcp server does not respond for a configurable timeout, then
      dhclient exits and the interface is not brought up - 
      the '-1' option is given to dhclient.
      If PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes, then dhclient will keep on trying
      to contact the dhcp server when it does not respond - no '-1'
      option is given to dhclient. Note: this disables the automatic
      checking for the presence of a link before starting dhclient.
    DHCPRELEASE=yes|no|1|0
:[K[K/[K      With this option set to 'yes' (1), when a dhcp configured
      interface is brought down with 'ifdown', the lease will be
      released. Otherwise, leases are not released.

    NO_DHCP_HOSTNAME=yes|no|1|0
      Tells initscripts to not obtain hostname from DHCP server in the ifup-post
      phase. This option might be useful especially with [7mstatic[27m configuration of
      the interface.
    DHCP_SEND_HOSTNAME=yes|no|1|0
      Tells initscripts whether the DHCP_HOSTNAME or DHCP_FQDN options (below)
      should be sent to DHCP server.
    DHCP_HOSTNAME=<hostname>
      Sends the specified hostname to the DHCP server.
:[K[K/[K    DHCP_FQDN=<fully.qualified.domain.name>
      Sends the specified FQDN to the DHCP server.

    Please note when both DHCP_HOSTNAME and DHCP_FQDN are specified,
    only DHCP_FQDN will be used. (Same behaviour as with NetworkManager.)

    DHCLIENT_IGNORE_GATEWAY=yes|no|1|0
      If set to 'yes', it will cause dhclient-script to ignore any $GATEWAY
      setting that may be in the ifcfg file for this interface.
      Otherwise, the dhclient session which obtains an ip-address
      on the same subnet as $GATEWAY will set the default route
      to be via $GATEWAY, and no other dhclient session will set
      the default route.
    DHCLIENTARGS=
      Any additional arguments to dhclient.
    NM_CONTROLLED=yes|no
      If set to 'no', NetworkManager will ignore this connection/device.
      Defaults to 'yes'.
    ZONE=
      Network zone (trust level) of this connection.
      If not set, default zone (specified in /etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf)
      is used. To see all available zones, run 'firewall-cmd --get-zones'.
    ARPCHECKn=yes|no
      If set to 'no', ifup will not try to determine, if requested ip address
      is used by other machine in network.
      Defaults to 'yes'.
    IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=yes|no
      If set to yes, ifup-eth will end immediately after ipv4 dhclient fails.
      Defaults to 'no'.

   CGROUP_DAEMON=
     List of control groups that the daemon will be run in. For example,
     CGROUP_DAEMON="cpu:daemons cpuacct:/" will run it in the daemons
     group for the CPU controller, and the '/' group for the CPU accounting
     controller.

/etc/sysconfig/authconfig

  information and authentication setup; changes made to this file
  have no effect until the next time authconfig is run

    USEHESIOD=no
      Whether or not the hesiod naming service is in use.  If not set,
      authconfig examines the passwd setting in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
    USELDAP=no
      Whether or not LDAP is used as a naming service.  If not set,
      authconfig examines the passwd setting in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
    USENIS=no
      Whether or not NIS is in use.  If not set, authconfig examines
      the passwd setting in /etc/nsswitch.conf.

    USEKERBEROS=no
      Whether or not Kerberos is in use.  If not set, authconfig examines
      the settings in /etc/pam.d/system-auth.
    USELDAPAUTH=no
      Whether or not LDAP is being used for authentication.  If not set,
      authconfig examines the settings in /etc/pam.d/system-auth.  Note
      that this option is separate from USELDAP, and that neither implies
      the other.

      'bootp' or 'dhcp' cause a DHCP client to run on the device. Any other
      value causes any static configuration in the file to be applied.
    VLAN=yes|no
    MTU=
      Default MTU for this device
    WINDOW=
      Default window for routes from this device
    PEERDNS=yes|no
      modify /etc/resolv.conf if peer uses msdns extension (PPP only) or
      DNS{1,2} are set, or if using dhclient. default to "yes".
    DNS{1,2}=<ip address>
      provide DNS addresses that are dropped into the resolv.conf
      file if PEERDNS is not set to "no".
    SCOPE=
      Set to "scope SCOPE-ID" to set a non-default scope for a statically
      configured IP address.
    SRCADDR=
      use the specified source address for outgoing packets
    HWADDR=
      ethernet hardware address for this device
    MACADDR=
      Set the hardware address for this device to this.
      Use of this in conjunction with HWADDR= may cause
      unintended behavior.
    NOZEROCONF=
      Set this to not set a route for dynamic link-local addresses
      over this device.
    PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes|no|1|0
      Without this option, or if it is 'no'/'0', and [7mBOOTPROTO[27m=dhcp,
      dhclient is run for the interface in "one-shot" mode; if the 
      dhcp server does not respond for a configurable timeout, then
      dhclient exits and the interface is not brought up - 
      the '-1' option is given to dhclient.
      If PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes, then dhclient will keep on trying
      to contact the dhcp server when it does not respond - no '-1'
      option is given to dhclient. Note: this disables the automatic
:[K[K/[K      checking for the presence of a link before starting dhclient.
    DHCPRELEASE=yes|no|1|0
      With this option set to 'yes' (1), when a dhcp configured
      interface is brought down with 'ifdown', the lease will be
      released. Otherwise, leases are not released.

    NO_DHCP_HOSTNAME=yes|no|1|0
      Tells initscripts to not obtain hostname from DHCP server in the ifup-post
      phase. This option might be useful especially with static configuration of
      the interface.
    DHCP_SEND_HOSTNAME=yes|no|1|0
      Tells initscripts whether the DHCP_HOSTNAME or DHCP_FQDN options (below)
      should be sent to DHCP server.
    DHCP_HOSTNAME=<hostname>
      Sends the specified hostname to the DHCP server.
    DHCP_FQDN=<fully.qualified.domain.name>
      Sends the specified FQDN to the DHCP server.

    Please note when both DHCP_HOSTNAME and DHCP_FQDN are specified,
    only DHCP_FQDN will be used. (Same behaviour as with NetworkManager.)

    DHCLIENT_IGNORE_GATEWAY=yes|no|1|0
      If set to 'yes', it will cause dhclient-script to ignore any $GATEWAY
      setting that may be in the ifcfg file for this interface.
      Otherwise, the dhclient session which obtains an ip-address
      on the same subnet as $GATEWAY will set the default route
      to be via $GATEWAY, and no other dhclient session will set
      the default route.

=======================

Generic options:

/etc/sysconfig/*

   CGROUP_DAEMON=
     List of control groups that the daemon will be run in. For example,
     CGROUP_DAEMON="cpu:daemons cpuacct:/" will run it in the daemons
     group for the CPU controller, and the '/' group for the CPU accounting
     controller.

/etc/sysconfig/authconfig

  used by authconfig to store information about the system's user
  information and authentication setup; changes made to this file
  have no effect until the next time authconfig is run

    USEHESIOD=no
      Whether or not the hesiod naming service is in use.  If not set,
      authconfig examines the passwd setting in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
    USELDAP=no
      Whether or not LDAP is used as a naming service.  If not set,
      authconfig examines the passwd setting in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
    USENIS=no
      Whether or not NIS is in use.  If not set, authconfig examines
      the passwd setting in /etc/nsswitch.conf.

    USEKERBEROS=no
      Whether or not Kerberos is in use.  If not set, authconfig examines
      the settings in /etc/pam.d/system-auth.
    USELDAPAUTH=no
      Whether or not LDAP is being used for authentication.  If not set,
      authconfig examines the settings in /etc/pam.d/system-auth.  Note
      that this option is separate from USELDAP, and that neither implies
      the other.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       The dhcpd.conf file contains configuration information for [4mdhcpd,[24m the Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Server.[m
[m
       The  dhcpd.conf  file is a free-form ASCII text file.  It is parsed by the recursive-descent parser built into[m
       dhcpd.  The file may contain extra tabs and newlines for formatting purposes.  Keywords in the file are  case-[m
       insensitive.  Comments may be placed anywhere within the file (except within quotes).  Comments begin with the[m
       # character and end at the end of the line.[m
[m
       The file essentially consists of a list of statements.  Statements fall into two broad categories - parameters[m
       and declarations.[m
[m
       Parameter statements either say how to do something (e.g., how long a lease to offer), whether to do something[m
       (e.g., should dhcpd provide addresses to unknown clients), or what parameters to provide to the client  (e.g.,[m
       use gateway 220.177.244.7).[m
[m
       Declarations  are used to describe the topology of the network, to describe clients on the network, to provide[m
       addresses that can be assigned to clients, or to apply a group of parameters to a group of  declarations.   In[m
       any  group  of  parameters  and  declarations,  all parameters must be specified before any declarations which[m
       depend on those parameters may be specified.[m
[m
       Declarations about network topology include the [4mshared-network[24m and the [4msubnet[24m declarations.  If clients  on  a[m
       subnet  are  to  be assigned addresses dynamically, a [4mrange[24m declaration must appear within the [4msubnet[24m declara‚Äê[m
       tion.  For clients with statically assigned addresses, or for installations where only known clients  will  be[m
       served, each such client must have a [4mhost[24m declaration.  If parameters are to be applied to a group of declara‚Äê[m
       tions which are not related strictly on a per-subnet basis, the [4mgroup[24m declaration can be used.[m
[m
       For every subnet which will be served, and for every subnet to which the dhcp server is connected, there  must[m
       be  one  [4msubnet[24m  declaration,  which tells dhcpd how to recognize that an address is on that subnet.  A [4msubnet[24m[m
       declaration is required for each subnet even if no addresses will be dynamically allocated on that subnet.[m

[m
       Notice that at the beginning of the file, there's a place for [7mglobal pa[27mrameters.  These might be  things  like[m
       the  organization's domain name, the addresses of the name servers (if they are common to the entire organiza‚Äê[m
       tion), and so on.  So, for example:[m
[m
            option domain-name "isc.org";[m
[7m Manual page dhcpd.conf(5) line 71 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K/[K            option domain-name-servers ns1.isc.org, ns2.isc.org;[m
[m
                                                          Figure 2[m
[m
       As you can see in Figure 2, you can specify host addresses in parameters using their domain names rather  than[m
       their  numeric  IP  addresses.  If a given hostname resolves to more than one IP address (for example, if that[m
       host has two ethernet interfaces), then where possible, both addresses are supplied to the client.[m
[m
       The most obvious reason for having subnet-specific parameters as shown in Figure 1 is  that  each  subnet,  of[m
       necessity, has its own router.  So for the first subnet, for example, there should be something like:[m
[m
            option routers 204.254.239.1;[m
[m
       Note  that  the  address here is specified numerically.  This is not required - if you have a different domain[m
       name for each interface on your router, it's perfectly legitimate to use the domain name  for  that  interface[m
       instead  of  the  numeric  address.   However,  in  many  cases there may be only one domain name for all of a[m
       router's IP addresses, and it would not be appropriate to use that name here.[m
[m
       In Figure 1 there is also a [4mgroup[24m statement, which provides common parameters for  a  set  of  three  hosts  -[m
       zappo,  beppo  and  harpo.   As  you can see, these hosts are all in the test.isc.org domain, so it might make[m
       sense for a group-specific parameter to override the domain name supplied to these hosts:[m
[m
            option domain-name "test.isc.org";[m
[m
       Also, given the domain they're in, these are probably test machines.  If we wanted to test  the  DHCP  leasing[m
       mechanism, we might set the lease timeout somewhat shorter than the default:[m
[m
            max-lease-time 120;[m
            default-lease-time 120;[m
[m
       You may have noticed that while some parameters start with the [4moption[24m keyword, some do not.  Parameters start‚Äê[m
       ing with the [4moption[24m keyword correspond to actual DHCP options, while parameters that do  not  start  with  the[m

[m
       As you can see in Figure 2, you can specify host addresses in parameters using their domain names rather  than[m
       their  numeric  IP  addresses.  If a given hostname resolves to more than one IP address (for example, if that[m
       host has two ethernet interfaces), then where possible, both addresses are supplied to the client.[m
[m
       The most obvious reason for having subnet-specific parameters as shown in Figure 1 is  that  each  subnet,  of[m
       necessity, has its own router.  So for the first subnet, for example, there should be something like:[m
[m
            option routers 204.254.239.1;[m
[m
       Note  that  the  address here is specified numerically.  This is not required - if you have a different domain[m
       name for each interface on your router, it's perfectly legitimate to use the domain name  for  that  interface[m
       instead  of  the  numeric  address.   However,  in  many  cases there may be only one domain name for all of a[m
       router's IP addresses, and it would not be appropriate to use that name here.[m
[m
       In Figure 1 there is also a [4mgroup[24m statement, which provides common parameters for  a  set  of  three  hosts  -[m
       zappo,  beppo  and  harpo.   As  you can see, these hosts are all in the test.isc.org domain, so it might make[m
       sense for a group-specific parameter to override the domain name supplied to these hosts:[m
[m
            option domain-name "test.isc.org";[m
[m
       Also, given the domain they're in, these are probably test machines.  If we wanted to test  the  DHCP  leasing[m
       mechanism, we might set the lease timeout somewhat shorter than the default:[m
[m
            max-lease-time 120;[m
            default-lease-time 120;[m
[m
       You may have noticed that while some parameters start with the [4moption[24m keyword, some do not.  Parameters start‚Äê[m
       ing with the [4moption[24m keyword correspond to actual DHCP options, while parameters that do  not  start  with  the[m

       The [1mhost[0m declaration provides a scope in which to provide configuration information about a  specific  client,[m
       and  also provides a way to assign a client a fixed address.  The host declaration provides a way for the DHCP[m
       server to identify a DHCP or BOOTP client, and also a way to assign the client a static IP address.[m
[m
       If it is desirable to be able to boot a DHCP or BOOTP client on more than one  subnet  with  fixed  addresses,[m
       more  than  one address may be specified in the [4mfixed-address[24m declaration, or more than one [1mhost[0m statement may[m
       be specified matching the same client.[m
[m
       If client-specific boot parameters must change based on the network to which the client is attached, then mul‚Äê[m
       tiple [1mhost[0m declarations should be used.  The [1mhost[0m declarations will only match a client if one of their [4mfixed-[24m[m
       [4maddress[24m statements is viable on the subnet (or shared network) where the client is attached.  Conversely,  for[m
       a  [1mhost[0m  declaration  to  match a client being allocated a dynamic address, it must not have any [4mfixed-address[24m[m
       statements.  You may therefore need a mixture of [1mhost[0m declarations for any given client...some  having  [4mfixed-[24m[m

[m
       [4mHost[24m declarations are matched to actual DHCP or BOOTP clients by matching the [4mdhcp-client-identifier[24m  or  [4mpxe-[24m[m

       The [1mhost[0m declaration provides a scope in which to provide configuration information about a  specific  client,[m
       and  also provides a way to assign a client a fixed address.  The host declaration provides a way for the DHCP[m
       server to identify a DHCP or BOOTP client, and also a way to assign the client a static IP address.[m
[m
       If it is desirable to be able to boot a DHCP or BOOTP client on more than one  subnet  with  fixed  addresses,[m
       more  than  one address may be specified in the [4mfixed-address[24m declaration, or more than one [1mhost[0m statement may[m
       be specified matching the same client.[m
[m
       If client-specific boot parameters must change based on the network to which the client is attached, then mul‚Äê[m
       tiple [1mhost[0m declarations should be used.  The [1mhost[0m declarations will only match a client if one of their [4mfixed-[24m[m
       [4maddress[24m statements is viable on the subnet (or shared network) where the client is attached.  Conversely,  for[m
       a  [1mhost[0m  declaration  to  match a client being allocated a dynamic address, it must not have any [4mfixed-address[24m[m
       statements.  You may therefore need a mixture of [1mhost[0m declarations for any given client...some  having  [4mfixed-[24m[m

[m
       [4mHost[24m declarations are matched to actual DHCP or BOOTP clients by matching the [4mdhcp-client-identifier[24m  or  [4mpxe-[24m[m

[m

       Notice that at the beginning of the file, there's a place for [7mglobal[27m parameters.  These might be  things  like[m
       the  organization's domain name, the addresses of the name servers (if they are common to the entire organiza‚Äê[m
       tion), and so on.  So, for example:[m
[m
            option domain-name "isc.org";[m

                                                          Figure 2[m
[m
       As you can see in Figure 2, you can specify host addresses in parameters using their domain names rather  than[m
       their  numeric  IP  addresses.  If a given hostname resolves to more than one IP address (for example, if that[m
       host has two ethernet interfaces), then where possible, both addresses are supplied to the client.[m
[m
       The most obvious reason for having subnet-specific parameters as shown in Figure 1 is  that  each  subnet,  of[m
       necessity, has its own router.  So for the first subnet, for example, there should be something like:[m
[m
            option routers 204.254.239.1;[m
[m
       Note  that  the  address here is specified numerically.  This is not required - if you have a different domain[m
       name for each interface on your router, it's perfectly legitimate to use the domain name  for  that  interface[m
       instead  of  the  numeric  address.   However,  in  many  cases there may be only one domain name for all of a[m
       router's IP addresses, and it would not be appropriate to use that name here.[m
[m
       In Figure 1 there is also a [4mgroup[24m statement, which provides common parameters for  a  set  of  three  hosts  -[m
       zappo,  beppo  and  harpo.   As  you can see, these hosts are all in the test.isc.org domain, so it might make[m
       sense for a group-specific parameter to override the domain name supplied to these hosts:[m
[m
            option domain-name "test.isc.org";[m
[m
       Also, given the domain they're in, these are probably test machines.  If we wanted to test  the  DHCP  leasing[m
       mechanism, we might set the lease timeout somewhat shorter than the default:[m
[m
            max-lease-time 120;[m
            default-lease-time 120;[m
[m
       You may have noticed that while some parameters start with the [4moption[24m keyword, some do not.  Parameters start‚Äê[m
       ing with the [4moption[24m keyword correspond to actual DHCP options, while parameters that do  not  start  with  the[m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       The dhcpd.conf file contains configuration information for [4mdhcpd,[24m the Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Server.[m
[m
       The  dhcpd.conf  file is a free-form ASCII text file.  It is parsed by the recursive-descent parser built into[m
       dhcpd.  The file may contain extra tabs and newlines for formatting purposes.  Keywords in the file are  case-[m
       insensitive.  Comments may be placed anywhere within the file (except within quotes).  Comments begin with the[m
       # character and end at the end of the line.[m
[m
       The file essentially consists of a list of statements.  Statements fall into two broad categories - parameters[m
       and declarations.[m
[m
       Parameter statements either say how to do something (e.g., how long a lease to offer), whether to do something[m
       (e.g., should dhcpd provide addresses to unknown clients), or what parameters to provide to the client  (e.g.,[m
       use gateway 220.177.244.7).[m
[m
       Declarations  are used to describe the topology of the network, to describe clients on the network, to provide[m
       addresses that can be assigned to clients, or to apply a group of parameters to a group of  declarations.   In[m
       any  group  of  parameters  and  declarations,  all parameters must be specified before any declarations which[m
       depend on those parameters may be specified.[m
[m
       Declarations about network topology include the [4mshared-network[24m and the [4msubnet[24m declarations.  If clients  on  a[m
       subnet  are  to  be assigned addresses dynamically, a [4mrange[24m declaration must appear within the [4msubnet[24m declara‚Äê[m
       tion.  For clients with statically assigned addresses, or for installations where only known clients  will  be[m
       served, each such client must have a [4mhost[24m declaration.  If parameters are to be applied to a group of declara‚Äê[m
       tions which are not related strictly on a per-subnet basis, the [4mgroup[24m declaration can be used.[m
[m
       For every subnet which will be served, and for every subnet to which the dhcp server is connected, there  must[m
       be  one  [4msubnet[24m  declaration,  which tells dhcpd how to recognize that an address is on that subnet.  A [4msubnet[24m[m
       declaration is required for each subnet even if no addresses will be dynamically allocated on that subnet.[m
[m
       Some installations have physical networks on which more than one IP subnet operates.  For example, if there is[m

[m
         This version of the DHCP Server evaluates pool balance on a schedule, rather than on demand  as  leases  are[m
         allocated.   The  latter  approach  proved  to  be slightly klunky when pool misbalanced reach total satura‚Äê[m
         tion...when any server ran out of leases to assign, it also lost its ability to notice it had run dry.[m
[m
         In order to understand pool balance, some elements of its operation first need to be defined.  First,  there[m
         are  ¬¥free¬¥ and ¬¥backup¬¥ leases.  Both of these are referred to as ¬¥free state leases¬¥.  ¬¥free¬¥ and ¬¥backup¬¥[m
         are ¬¥the free states¬¥ for the purpose of this document.  The difference is that only the primary  may  allo‚Äê[m
         cate  from  ¬¥free¬¥  leases  unless under special circumstances, and only the secondary may allocate ¬¥backup¬¥[m
         leases.[m
[m
         When pool balance is performed, the only plausible expectation is to provide a 50/50 split of the free state[m
         leases  between  the  two servers.  This is because no one can predict which server will fail, regardless of[m
         the relative load placed upon the two servers, so giving each server half the leases gives both servers  the[m
         same  amount  of ¬¥failure endurance¬¥.  Therefore, there is no way to configure any different behaviour, out‚Äê[m
         side of some very small windows we will describe shortly.[m
[m
         The first thing calculated on any pool balance run is a value referred to as ¬¥lts¬¥,  or  "Leases  To  Send".[m
         This,  simply, is the difference in the count of free and backup leases, divided by two.  For the secondary,[m
         it is the difference in the backup and free leases, divided by two.  The resulting value is signed: if it is[m
         positive, the local server is expected to hand out leases to retain a 50/50 balance.  If it is negative, the[m
         remote server would need to send leases to balance the pool.  Once the lts value reaches zero, the  pool  is[m
         perfectly balanced (give or take one lease in the case of an odd number of total free state leases).[m
[m
         The  current approach is still something of a hybrid of the old approach, marked by the presence of the [1mmax-[0m[m
         [1mlease-misbalance[0m statement.  This parameter configures what used to be a 10% fixed value  in  previous  ver‚Äê[m
         sions: if lts is less than free+backup * [1m[7mmax-lease[27m[0m[1m-misbalance[0m percent, then the server will skip balancing a[m
         given pool (it won't bother moving any leases, even if some leases "should" be moved).  The meaning of  this[m
         value  is  also  somewhat  overloaded, however, in that it also governs the estimation of when to attempt to[m
         balance the pool (which may then also be skipped over).  The oldest leases in the free and backup states are[m
         examined.  The time they have resided in their respective queues is used as an estimate to indicate how much[m
         time it is probable it would take before the leases at the top of the list would be consumed (and thus,  how[m
         long  it  would take to use all leases in that state).  This percentage is directly multiplied by this time,[m
[7m Manual page dhcpd.conf(5) line 528 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K/[K         and fit into the schedule if it falls within the [1mmin-balance[0m and [1mmax-balance[0m configured values.  The  sched‚Äê[m
[7m Manual page dhcpd.conf(5) line 529 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K/[K         uled  pool  check time is only moved in a downwards direction, it is never increased.  Lastly, if the lts is[m
         more than double this number in the negative direction,  the  local  server  will  ¬¥panic¬¥  and  transmit  a[m
         Failover protocol POOLREQ message, in the hopes that the remote system will be woken up into action.[m
[m
         Once  the  lts  value  exceeds  the  [1m[7mmax-lease[27m[0m[1m-misbalance[0m percentage of total free state leases as described[m
         above, leases are moved to the remote server.  This is done in two passes.[m
[m
         In the first pass, only leases whose most recent bound client would have been served by the remote server  -[m
         according  to the Load Balance Algorithm (see above [1msplit[0m and [1mhba[0m configuration statements) - are given away[m
         to the peer.  This first pass will happily continue to give away leases, decrementing the lts value  by  one[m
         for  each, until the lts value has reached the negative of the total number of leases multiplied by the [1mmax-[0m[m
         [1mlease-ownership[0m percentage.  So it is through this value that you can permit a small misbalance of the lease[m
         pools - for the purpose of giving the peer more than a 50/50 share of leases in the hopes that their clients[m
         might some day return and be allocated by the peer (operating normally).  This process  is  referred  to  as[m
         ¬¥MAC Address Affinity¬¥, but this is somewhat misnamed: it applies equally to DHCP Client Identifier options.[m
         Note also that affinity is applied to leases when they enter the state ¬¥free¬¥ from ¬¥expired¬¥ or  ¬¥released¬¥.[m
         In  this  case also, leases will not be moved from free to backup if the secondary already has more than its[m
         share.[m
[m
         The second pass is only entered into if the first pass fails to reduce the lts underneath the  total  number[m
         of  free state leases multiplied by the [1m[7mmax-lease[27m[0m[1m-ownership[0m percentage.  In this pass, the oldest leases are[m
         given over to the peer without second thought about the Load Balance Algorithm, and this continues until the[m
         lts  falls under this value.  In this way, the local server will also happily keep a small percentage of the[m
         leases that would normally load balance to itself.[m
[m
         So, the [1m[7mmax-lease[27m[0m[1m-misbalance[0m value acts as a behavioural gate.  Smaller values will  cause  more  leases  to[m
         transition  states to balance the pools over time, higher values will decrease the amount of change (but may[m
         lead to pool starvation if there's a run on leases).[m
[m
[7m Manual page dhcpd.conf(5) line 558 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K/[K         The [1m[7mmax-lease[27m[0m[1m-ownership[0m value permits a small (percentage) skew in the lease balance of a percentage of  the[m
         total number of free state leases.[m
[m
         Finally, the [1mmin-balance[0m and [1mmax-balance[0m make certain that a scheduled rebalance event happens within a rea‚Äê[m
         sonable timeframe (not to be thrown off by, for example, a 7 year old free lease).[m
[m
         Plausible values for the percentages lie between 0 and 100, inclusive, but values over 50 are indistinguish‚Äê[m
         able from one another (once lts exceeds 50% of the free state leases, one server must therefore have 100% of[m
         the leases in its respective free state).  It is recommended to select a [1m[7mmax-lease[27m[0m[1m-ownership[0m value  that  is[m
         lower  than  the value selected for the [1m[7mmax-lease[27m[0m[1m-misbalance[0m value.  [1m[7mmax-lease[27m[0m[1m-ownership[0m defaults to 10, and[m

[1mCLIENT[0m [1mCLASSING[0m[m
       Clients can be separated into classes, and treated differently depending on what class they are in.  This sep‚Äê[m
       aration  can  be done either with a conditional statement, or with a match statement within the class declara‚Äê[m
       tion.  It is possible to specify a limit on the total number of clients within a particular class or  subclass[m
       that may hold leases at one time, and it is possible to specify automatic subclassing based on the contents of[m
       the client packet.[m
[m
       To add clients to classes based on conditional evaluation, you can specify a matching expression in the  class[m
       statement:[m
[m
       class "ras-clients" {[m
         match if substring (option dhcp-client-identifier, 1, 3) = "RAS";[m

[m
       Note  that  whether  you  use  matching  expressions or add statements (or both) to classify clients, you must[m
       always write a class declaration for any class that you use.  If there will be no match statement and  no  in-[m

       a smaller set of addresses, possibly with short [7mlease[27m times, that are available for unknown clients.   If  you[m
       have  a firewall, you may be able to arrange for addresses from one pool to be allowed access to the Internet,[m
       while addresses in another pool are not, thus encouraging users to register their DHCP clients.  To  do  this,[m
       you would set up a pair of pool declarations:[m
[m
       subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {[m
         option routers 10.0.0.254;[m

         # Unknown clients get this pool.[m
         pool {[m
           option domain-name-servers bogus.example.com;[m
           max-[7mlease[27m-time 300;[m
           range 10.0.0.200 10.0.0.253;[m
           allow unknown-clients;[m
         }[m
[m
         # Known clients get this pool.[m
         pool {[m

           deny unknown-clients;[m
         }[m
       }[m
[m
       It  is  also possible to set up entirely different subnets for known and unknown clients - address pools exist[m
       at the level of shared networks, so address ranges within pool declarations can be on different subnets.[m
[m
       As you can see in the preceding example, pools can have permit lists that control which  clients  are  allowed[m
       access  to the pool and which aren't.  Each entry in a pool's permit list is introduced with the [4mallow[24m or [4mdeny[24m[m
       keyword.  If a pool has a permit list, then only those clients that match specific entries on the permit  list[m
       will  be  eligible to be assigned addresses from the pool.  If a pool has a deny list, then only those clients[m
       that do not match any entries on the deny list will be eligible.   If both permit and deny lists exist  for  a[m
       pool, then only clients that match the permit list and do not match the deny list will be allowed access.[m

[m
       When  the DHCP server allocates a new address for a client (remember, this only happens if the client has sent[m

       take that address and check it to see if the client is still permitted to use it.  If the client is no  longer[m
       permitted  to  use it, the [7mlease[27m is freed if the server thought it was still in use - the fact that the client[m
       has sent a DHCPDISCOVER proves to the server that the client is no longer using the [7mlease[27m.[m
[m
       If no existing [7mlease[27m is found, or if the client is forbidden to receive the existing [7mlease[27m,  then  the  server[m
       will  look  in  the  list of address pools for the network segment to which the client is attached for a [7mlease[27m[m
       that is not in use and that the client is permitted to have.   It  looks  through  each  pool  declaration  in[m
       sequence  (all [4mrange[24m declarations that appear outside of pool declarations are grouped into a single pool with[m
       no permit list).  If the permit list for the pool allows the client to be allocated an address from that pool,[m
       the  pool is examined to see if there is an address available.  If so, then the client is tentatively assigned[m
       that address.  Otherwise, the next pool is tested.  If no addresses are found that  can  be  assigned  to  the[m
       client, no response is sent to the client.[m
[m
       If  an  address  is found that the client is permitted to have, and that has never been assigned to any client[m
       before, the address is immediately allocated to the client.  If the address is available  for  allocation  but[m
       has  been  previously  assigned  to  a  different  client, the server will keep looking in hopes of finding an[m

       The  failover  protocol defines a primary server role and a [7msecond[27mary server role.  There are some differences[m
       in how primaries and [7msecond[27maries act, but most of the differences simply have to do with providing a  way  for[m
       each  peer to behave in the opposite way from the other.  So one server must be configured as primary, and the[m
       other must be configured as [7msecond[27mary, and it doesn't matter too much which one is which.[m
[m
[1mFAILOVER[0m [1mSTARTUP[0m[m
       When a server starts that has not previously communicated with its failover peer, it must establish communica‚Äê[m
       tions  with  its  failover  peer  and synchronize with it before it can serve clients.  This can happen either[m
       because you have just configured your DHCP servers to perform failover for the first time, or because  one  of[m
       your failover servers has failed catastrophically and lost its database.[m
[m
       The  initial  recovery  process  is designed to ensure that when one failover peer loses its database and then[m
       resynchronizes, any leases that the failed server gave out before it failed will be honored.  When the  failed[m
       server starts up, it notices that it has no saved failover state, and attempts to contact its peer.[m
[m
       When  it  has  established  contact, it asks the peer for a complete copy its peer's lease database.  The peer[m
       then sends its complete database, and sends a message indicating that it is  done.   The  failed  server  then[m
       waits until MCLT has passed, and once MCLT has passed both servers make the transition back into normal opera‚Äê[m
       tion.  This waiting period ensures that any leases the failed server may have given out while out  of  contact[m
       with its partner will have expired.[m
[m
       While  the  failed server is recovering, its partner remains in the partner-down state, which means that it is[m
       serving all clients.  The failed server provides no service at all to DHCP clients until it has made the tran‚Äê[m
       sition into normal operation.[m
[m
       In  the  case where both servers detect that they have never before communicated with their partner, they both[m
       come up in this recovery state and follow the procedure we have just described.  In this case, no service will[m
       be provided to DHCP clients until MCLT has expired.[m
[m
[1mCONFIGURING[0m [1mFAILOVER[0m[m
       In  order  to  configure failover, you need to write a peer declaration that configures the failover protocol,[m
       and you need to write peer references in each pool declaration for which you want to do failover.  You do  not[m
       have  to  do  failover  for  all  pools  on a given network segment.   You must not tell one server it's doing[m
       failover on a particular address pool and tell the other it is not.  You must  not  have  any  common  address[m
       pools on which you are not doing failover.  A pool declaration that utilizes failover would look like this:[m

         This statement allows you to configure a cutoff after which load balancing is disabled.  The cutoff is based[m

         with clients that correctly implement the [4msecs[24m field - fortunately most clients do.   We  recommend  setting[m
         this  to  something  like 3 or 5.  The effect of this is that if one of the failover peers gets into a state[m
         where it is responding to failover messages but not responding to some client requests, the  other  failover[m
         peer will take over its client load automatically as the clients retry.[m

         This  statement  instructs the server to initiate a timed delay upon entering the communications-interrupted[m
         state (any situation of being out-of-contact with the remote failover  peer).   At  the  conclusion  of  the[m
         timer,  the  server  will  automatically  enter the partner-down state.  This permits the server to allocate[m
         leases from the partner's free lease pool after an STOS+MCLT timer expires, which can be  dangerous  if  the[m
         partner is in fact operating at the time (the two servers will give conflicting bindings).[m
[m
         Think  very  carefully before enabling this feature.  The partner-down and communications-interrupted states[m
         are intentionally segregated because there do exist situations where a failover server can fail to  communi‚Äê[m
         cate  with  its peer, but still has the ability to receive and reply to requests from DHCP clients.  In gen‚Äê[m
         eral, this feature should only be used in those deployments where the failover  servers  are  directly  con‚Äê[m
         nected to one another, such as by a dedicated hardwired link ("a heartbeat cable").[m

[m
         In order to understand pool balance, some elements of its operation first need to be defined.  First,  there[m
[7m Manual page dhcpd.conf(5) line 501/1945 27% (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K/[K         are  ¬¥free¬¥ and ¬¥backup¬¥ leases.  Both of these are referred to as ¬¥free state leases¬¥.  ¬¥free¬¥ and ¬¥backup¬¥[m
         are ¬¥the free states¬¥ for the purpose of this document.  The difference is that only the primary  may  allo‚Äê[m
         cate  from  ¬¥free¬¥  leases  unless under special circumstances, and only the secondary may allocate ¬¥backup¬¥[m
         leases.[m
[m
         When pool balance is performed, the only plausible expectation is to provide a 50/50 split of the free state[m
         leases  between  the  two servers.  This is because no one can predict which server will fail, regardless of[m
         the relative load placed upon the two servers, so giving each server half the leases gives both servers  the[m
[7m Manual page dhcpd.conf(5) line 509/1945 28% (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K/[K         same  amount  of ¬¥failure endurance¬¥.  Therefore, there is no way to configure any different behaviour, out‚Äê[m
         side of some very small windows we will describe shortly.[m
[m
         The first thing calculated on any pool balance run is a value referred to as ¬¥lts¬¥,  or  "Leases  To  Send".[m
         This,  simply, is the difference in the count of free and backup leases, divided by two.  For the secondary,[m
         it is the difference in the backup and free leases, divided by two.  The resulting value is signed: if it is[m
         positive, the local server is expected to hand out leases to retain a 50/50 balance.  If it is negative, the[m
         remote server would need to send leases to balance the pool.  Once the lts value reaches zero, the  pool  is[m
         perfectly balanced (give or take one lease in the case of an odd number of total free state leases).[m
[m
         The  current approach is still something of a hybrid of the old approach, marked by the presence of the [1mmax-[0m[m
         [1mlease-misbalance[0m statement.  This parameter configures what used to be a 10% fixed value  in  previous  ver‚Äê[m
         sions: if lts is less than free+backup * [1mmax-lease-misbalance[0m percent, then the server will skip balancing a[m
         given pool (it won't bother moving any leases, even if some leases "should" be moved).  The meaning of  this[m
         value  is  also  somewhat  overloaded, however, in that it also governs the estimation of when to attempt to[m

         examined.  The time they have resided in their respective queues is used as an estimate to indicate how much[m
         time it is probable it would take before the leases at the top of the list would be consumed (and thus,  how[m
         long  it  would take to use all leases in that state).  This percentage is directly multiplied by this time,[m
         and fit into the schedule if it falls within the [1mmin-balance[0m and [1mmax-balance[0m configured values.  The  sched‚Äê[m

         The DHCP and BOOTP protocols both require DHCP and BOOTP clients to set the broadcast bit in the flags field[m
         of the BOOTP message header.  Unfortunately, some DHCP and BOOTP clients do not do this, and  therefore  may[m
         not  receive  responses from the DHCP server.  The DHCP server can be made to always broadcast its responses[m
         to clients by setting this flag to ¬¥on¬¥ for the relevant scope; relevant scopes would  be  inside  a  condi‚Äê[m

         timer,  the  server  will  automatically  enter the partner-down state.  This permits the server to allocate[m
         leases from the partner's free lease pool after an STOS+MCLT timer expires, which can be  dangerous  if  the[m
         partner is in fact operating at the time (the two servers will give conflicting bindings).[m
[m
         Think  very  carefully before enabling this feature.  The partner-down and communications-interrupted states[m
         are intentionally segregated because there do exist situations where a failover server can fail to  communi‚Äê[m

[m
         When pool balance is performed, the only plausible expectation is to provide a 50/50 split of the free state[m
         leases  between  the  two servers.  This is because no one can predict which server will fail, regardless of[m
         the relative load placed upon the two servers, so giving each server half the leases gives both servers  the[m

         side of some very small windows we will describe shortly.[m
[m
         The first thing calculated on any pool balance run is a value referred to as ¬¥lts¬¥,  or  "Leases  To  Send".[m
         This,  simply, is the difference in the count of free and backup leases, divided by two.  For the secondary,[m
         it is the difference in the backup and free leases, divided by two.  The resulting value is signed: if it is[m
         positive, the local server is expected to hand out leases to retain a 50/50 balance.  If it is negative, the[m
         remote server would need to send leases to balance the pool.  Once the lts value reaches zero, the  pool  is[m
         perfectly balanced (give or take one lease in the case of an odd number of total free state leases).[m
[m
         The  current approach is still something of a hybrid of the old approach, marked by the presence of the [1mmax-[0m[m
         [1mlease-misbalance[0m statement.  This parameter configures what used to be a 10% fixed value  in  previous  ver‚Äê[m
         sions: if lts is less than free+backup * [1mmax-lease-misbalance[0m percent, then the server will skip balancing a[m
         given pool (it won't bother moving any leases, even if some leases "should" be moved).  The meaning of  this[m
         value  is  also  somewhat  overloaded, however, in that it also governs the estimation of when to attempt to[m

         time it is probable it would take before the leases at the top of the list would be consumed (and thus,  how[m
         long  it  would take to use all leases in that state).  This percentage is directly multiplied by this time,[m

[1mNAME[0m[m
       dhcpd.conf - dhcpd configuration file[m
[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       The dhcpd.conf file contains configuration information for [4mdhcpd,[24m the Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Server.[m
[m
       The  dhcpd.conf  file is a free-form ASCII text file.  It is parsed by the recursive-descent parser built into[m
       dhcpd.  The file may contain extra tabs and newlines for formatting purposes.  Keywords in the file are  case-[m
       insensitive.  Comments may be placed anywhere within the file (except within quotes).  Comments begin with the[m
       # character and end at the end of the line.[m
[m
       The file essentially consists of a list of statements.  Statements fall into two broad categories - parameters[m
       and declarations.[m
[m
       Parameter statements either say how to do something (e.g., how long a lease to offer), whether to do something[m
       (e.g., should dhcpd provide addresses to unknown clients), or what parameters to provide to the client  (e.g.,[m
       use gateway 220.177.244.7).[m
[m
       Declarations  are used to describe the topology of the network, to describe clients on the network, to provide[m
       addresses that can be assigned to clients, or to apply a group of parameters to a group of  declarations.   In[m
       any  group  of  parameters  and  declarations,  all parameters must be specified before any declarations which[m
       depend on those parameters may be specified.[m
[m
       Declarations about network topology include the [4mshared-network[24m and the [4msubnet[24m declarations.  If clients  on  a[m
       subnet  are  to  be assigned addresses dynamically, a [4mrange[24m declaration must appear within the [4msubnet[24m declara‚Äê[m
       tion.  For clients with statically assigned addresses, or for installations where only known clients  will  be[m
       served, each such client must have a [4mhost[24m declaration.  If parameters are to be applied to a group of declara‚Äê[m
       tions which are not related strictly on a per-subnet basis, the [4mgroup[24m declaration can be used.[m
[m
       For every subnet which will be served, and for every subnet to which the dhcp server is connected, there  must[m
       be  one  [4msubnet[24m  declaration,  which tells dhcpd how to recognize that an address is on that subnet.  A [4msubnet[24m[m
       declaration is required for each subnet even if no addresses will be dynamically allocated on that subnet.[m
[m
       Some installations have physical networks on which more than one IP subnet operates.  For example, if there is[m
       a site-wide requirement that 8-bit subnet masks be used, but a department with a single physical ethernet net‚Äê[m
[7m Manual page dhcpd.conf(5) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K       work expands to the point where it has more than 254 nodes, it may be necessary to run two  8-bit  subnets  on[m
       the  same  ethernet until such time as a new physical network can be added.  In this case, the [4msubnet[24m declara‚Äê[m
       tions for these two networks must be enclosed in a [4mshared-network[24m declaration.[m
[m
       Note that even when the [4mshared-network[24m declaration is absent, an empty one is created by the server to contain[m
       the  [4msubnet[24m  (and  any  scoped  parameters  included  in the [4msubnet[24m).  For practical purposes, this means that[m
       "stateless" DHCP clients, which are not tied to addresses (and therefore subnets) will receive the  same  con‚Äê[m
       figuration as stateful ones.[m
[m
       Some  sites  may have departments which have clients on more than one subnet, but it may be desirable to offer[m
       those clients a uniform set of parameters which are different than what would be offered to clients from other[m
       departments  on  the same subnet.  For clients which will be declared explicitly with [4mhost[24m declarations, these[m
       declarations can be enclosed in a [4mgroup[24m declaration along with the parameters which are common to that depart‚Äê[m
       ment.   For  clients whose addresses will be dynamically assigned, class declarations and conditional declara‚Äê[m
       tions may be used to group parameter assignments based on information the client sends.[m
[m
       When a client is to be booted, its boot parameters are determined by consulting that client's [4mhost[24m declaration[m
       (if  any),  and  then  consulting any [4mclass[24m declarations matching the client, followed by the [4mpool[24m, [4msubnet[24m and[m
       [4mshared-network[24m declarations for the IP address assigned to the client.   Each  of  these  declarations  itself[m
       appears  within  a  lexical scope, and all declarations at less specific lexical scopes are also consulted for[m
       client option declarations.  Scopes are never considered twice, and if parameters are declared  in  more  than[m
       one scope, the parameter declared in the most specific scope is the one that is used.[m
[m
       When  dhcpd  tries  to find a [4mhost[24m declaration for a client, it first looks for a [4mhost[24m declaration which has a[m
       [4mfixed-address[24m declaration that lists an IP address that is valid for the subnet or shared network on which the[m
       client  is  booting.   If it doesn't find any such entry, it tries to find an entry which has no [4mfixed-address[24m[m
       declaration.[m

[1mNAME[0m[m
       dhcpd.conf - dhcpd configuration file[m
[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       The dhcpd.conf file contains configuration information for [4mdhcpd,[24m the Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Server.[m
[m
       The  dhcpd.conf  file is a free-form ASCII text file.  It is parsed by the recursive-descent parser built into[m
       dhcpd.  The file may contain extra tabs and newlines for formatting purposes.  Keywords in the file are  case-[m
       insensitive.  Comments may be placed anywhere within the file (except within quotes).  Comments begin with the[m
       # character and end at the end of the line.[m
[m
       The file essentially consists of a list of statements.  Statements fall into two broad categories - parameters[m
       and declarations.[m
[m
       Parameter statements either say how to do something (e.g., how long a lease to offer), whether to do something[m
       (e.g., should dhcpd provide addresses to unknown clients), or what parameters to provide to the client  (e.g.,[m
       use gateway 220.177.244.7).[m
[m
       Declarations  are used to describe the topology of the network, to describe clients on the network, to provide[m
       addresses that can be assigned to clients, or to apply a group of parameters to a group of  declarations.   In[m
       any  group  of  parameters  and  declarations,  all parameters must be specified before any declarations which[m
       depend on those parameters may be specified.[m
[m
       Declarations about network topology include the [4mshared-network[24m and the [4msubnet[24m declarations.  If clients  on  a[m
       subnet  are  to  be assigned addresses dynamically, a [4mrange[24m declaration must appear within the [4msubnet[24m declara‚Äê[m
       tion.  For clients with statically assigned addresses, or for installations where only known clients  will  be[m
       served, each such client must have a [4mhost[24m declaration.  If parameters are to be applied to a group of declara‚Äê[m
       tions which are not related strictly on a per-subnet basis, the [4mgroup[24m declaration can be used.[m
[m
       For every subnet which will be served, and for every subnet to which the dhcp server is connected, there  must[m
       be  one  [4msubnet[24m  declaration,  which tells dhcpd how to recognize that an address is on that subnet.  A [4msubnet[24m[m
       declaration is required for each subnet even if no addresses will be dynamically allocated on that subnet.[m
[m
       Some installations have physical networks on which more than one IP subnet operates.  For example, if there is[m
       a site-wide requirement that 8-bit subnet masks be used, but a department with a single physical ethernet net‚Äê[m
[7m Manual page dhcpd.conf(5) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K [KESCESC[K[[[K66[K~~[K       work expands to the point where it has more than 254 nodes, it may be necessary to run two  8-bit  subnets  on[m
       the  same  ethernet until such time as a new physical network can be added.  In this case, the [4msubnet[24m declara‚Äê[m
       tions for these two networks must be enclosed in a [4mshared-network[24m declaration.[m
[m
       Note that even when the [4mshared-network[24m declaration is absent, an empty one is created by the server to contain[m
       the  [4msubnet[24m  (and  any  scoped  parameters  included  in the [4msubnet[24m).  For practical purposes, this means that[m
       "stateless" DHCP clients, which are not tied to addresses (and therefore subnets) will receive the  same  con‚Äê[m
       figuration as stateful ones.[m
[m
       Some  sites  may have departments which have clients on more than one subnet, but it may be desirable to offer[m
       those clients a uniform set of parameters which are different than what would be offered to clients from other[m
       departments  on  the same subnet.  For clients which will be declared explicitly with [4mhost[24m declarations, these[m
       declarations can be enclosed in a [4mgroup[24m declaration along with the parameters which are common to that depart‚Äê[m
       ment.   For  clients whose addresses will be dynamically assigned, class declarations and conditional declara‚Äê[m
       tions may be used to group parameter assignments based on information the client sends.[m
[m
       When a client is to be booted, its boot parameters are determined by consulting that client's [4mhost[24m declaration[m
       (if  any),  and  then  consulting any [4mclass[24m declarations matching the client, followed by the [4mpool[24m, [4msubnet[24m and[m
       [4mshared-network[24m declarations for the IP address assigned to the client.   Each  of  these  declarations  itself[m
       appears  within  a  lexical scope, and all declarations at less specific lexical scopes are also consulted for[m
       client option declarations.  Scopes are never considered twice, and if parameters are declared  in  more  than[m
       one scope, the parameter declared in the most specific scope is the one that is used.[m
[m
       When  dhcpd  tries  to find a [4mhost[24m declaration for a client, it first looks for a [4mhost[24m declaration which has a[m
       [4mfixed-address[24m declaration that lists an IP address that is valid for the subnet or shared network on which the[m
       client  is  booting.   If it doesn't find any such entry, it tries to find an entry which has no [4mfixed-address[24m[m
       declaration.[m

       Notice that at the beginning of the file, there's a place for global parameters.  These might be  things  like[m
       the  organization's domain name, the addresses of the name servers (if they are common to the entire organiza‚Äê[m
       tion), and so on.  So, for example:[m
[m
            option domain-name "isc.org";[m
            option domain-name-servers ns1.isc.org, ns2.isc.org;[m

       As you can see in Figure 2, you can specify host addresses in parameters using their domain names rather  than[m
       their  numeric  IP  addresses.  If a given hostname resolves to more than one IP address (for example, if that[m
       host has two ethernet interfaces), then where possible, both addresses are supplied to the client.[m

[7m Manual page dhcpd.conf(5) line 79 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K/[K       The most obvious reason for having [7msubnet[27m-specific parameters as shown in Figure 1 is  that  each  [7msubnet[27m,  of[m
       necessity, has its own router.  So for the first [7msubnet[27m, for example, there should be something like:[m
[m
            option routers 204.254.239.1;[m
[7m Manual page dhcpd.conf(5) line 83 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K/[K[m
[7m Manual page dhcpd.conf(5) line 84 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K/[K       Note  that  the  address here is specified numerically.  This is not required - if you have a different domain[m
       name for each interface on your router, it's perfectly legitimate to use the domain name  for  that  interface[m
       instead  of  the  numeric  address.   However,  in  many  cases there may be only one domain name for all of a[m
       router's IP addresses, and it would not be appropriate to use that name here.[m
[m
       In Figure 1 there is also a [4mgroup[24m statement, which provides common parameters for  a  set  of  three  hosts  -[m
       zappo,  beppo  and  harpo.   As  you can see, these hosts are all in the test.isc.org domain, so it might make[m
       sense for a group-specific parameter to override the domain name supplied to these hosts:[m
[m
            option domain-name "test.isc.org";[m
[m
       Also, given the domain they're in, these are probably test machines.  If we wanted to test  the  DHCP  leasing[m
       mechanism, we might set the lease timeout somewhat shorter than the default:[m
[m
            max-lease-time 120;[m
            default-lease-time 120;[m
[m
       You may have noticed that while some parameters start with the [4moption[24m keyword, some do not.  Parameters start‚Äê[m
       ing with the [4moption[24m keyword correspond to actual DHCP options, while parameters that do  not  start  with  the[m
       option keyword either control the behavior of the DHCP server (e.g., how long a lease dhcpd will give out), or[m
       specify client parameters that are not optional in the DHCP protocol (for example, server-name and filename).[m
[m
       In Figure 1, each host had [4mhost-specific[24m [4mparameters[24m.  These could include such things as the [4mhostname[24m  option,[m
       the  name  of a file to upload (the [4mfilename[24m parameter) and the address of the server from which to upload the[m
       file (the [4mnext-server[24m parameter).  In general, any parameter can appear anywhere that parameters are  allowed,[m
       and will be applied according to the scope in which the parameter appears.[m
[m
       Imagine  that you have a site with a lot of NCD X-Terminals.  These terminals come in a variety of models, and[m
       you want to specify the boot files for each model.  One way to do this would be to have host declarations  for[m
       each server and group them by model:[m
[m
       group {[m

       pool of addresses, even on the same network segment or [7msubnet[27m.  For example, you may want to provide  a  large[m
       set of addresses that can be assigned to DHCP clients that are registered to your DHCP server, while providing[m
       a smaller set of addresses, possibly with short lease times, that are available for unknown clients.   If  you[m
       have  a firewall, you may be able to arrange for addresses from one pool to be allowed access to the Internet,[m
       while addresses in another pool are not, thus encouraging users to register their DHCP clients.  To  do  this,[m
       you would set up a pair of pool declarations:[m
[m
       [7msubnet[27m 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {[m
         option routers 10.0.0.254;[m
[m
         # Unknown clients get this pool.[m
         pool {[m
           option domain-name-servers bogus.example.com;[m
           max-lease-time 300;[m
           range 10.0.0.200 10.0.0.253;[m
           allow unknown-clients;[m
         }[m
[m
         # Known clients get this pool.[m
         pool {[m
           option domain-name-servers ns1.example.com, ns2.example.com;[m
           max-lease-time 28800;[m
           range 10.0.0.5 10.0.0.199;[m
           deny unknown-clients;[m
         }[m
       }[m
[m
       It  is  also possible to set up entirely different [7msubnet[27ms for known and unknown clients - address pools exist[m
       at the level of shared networks, so address ranges within pool declarations can be on different [7msubnet[27ms.[m
[m
       As you can see in the preceding example, pools can have permit lists that control which  clients  are  allowed[m
       access  to the pool and which aren't.  Each entry in a pool's permit list is introduced with the [4mallow[24m or [4mdeny[24m[m
       keyword.  If a pool has a permit list, then only those clients that match specific entries on the permit  list[m
       will  be  eligible to be assigned addresses from the pool.  If a pool has a deny list, then only those clients[m
       that do not match any entries on the deny list will be eligible.   If both permit and deny lists exist  for  a[m
       pool, then only clients that match the permit list and do not match the deny list will be allowed access.[m

       Address  allocation  is actually only done when a client is in the INIT state and has sent a DHCPDISCOVER mes‚Äê[m
       sage.  If the client thinks it has a valid lease and sends a DHCPREQUEST to initiate or renew that lease,  the[m
       server  has  only  three  choices - it can ignore the DHCPREQUEST, send a DHCPNAK to tell the client it should[m
       stop using the address, or send a DHCPACK, telling the client to go ahead and use the address for a while.[m
[m
       If the server finds the address the client is requesting, and that address is available  to  the  client,  the[m
[7m Manual page dhcpd.conf(5) line 188 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K/[K       server  will send a DHCPACK.  If the address is no longer available, or the client isn't permitted to have it,[m
       the server will send a DHCPNAK.  If the server knows nothing about the address, it will remain silent,  unless[m
       the  address  is  incorrect  for  the  network segment to which the client has been attached and the server is[m
       authoritative for that network segment, in which case the server will send a DHCPNAK even  though  it  doesn't[m
       know about the address.[m
[m
       There  may  be  a  host declaration matching the client's identification.  If that host declaration contains a[m
       fixed-address declaration that lists an IP address that is valid for the network segment to which  the  client[m
       is  connected.   In  this  case,  the DHCP server will never do dynamic address allocation.  In this case, the[m
       client is [4mrequired[24m to take the address specified in the host declaration.  If the client sends  a  DHCPREQUEST[m
       for some other address, the server will respond with a DHCPNAK.[m
[m
       When  the DHCP server allocates a new address for a client (remember, this only happens if the client has sent[m
       a DHCPDISCOVER), it first looks to see if the client already has a valid lease on an IP address, or  if  there[m
       is  an  old  IP  address the client had before that hasn't yet been reassigned.  In that case, the server will[m
       take that address and check it to see if the client is still permitted to use it.  If the client is no  longer[m
       permitted  to  use it, the lease is freed if the server thought it was still in use - the fact that the client[m
       has sent a DHCPDISCOVER proves to the server that the client is no longer using the lease.[m
[m
       If no existing lease is found, or if the client is forbidden to receive the existing lease,  then  the  server[m

[m
       The data following the class name in the subclass declaration is a constant value to use in matching the match[m
       expression for the class.  When class matching is done, the server will evaluate the match expression and then[m
       look the result up in the hash table.  If it finds a match, the client is considered  a  member  of  both  the[m
       class and the subclass.[m
[m
       Subclasses  can  be declared with or without scope.  In the above example, the sole purpose of the subclass is[m
       to allow some clients access to one address pool, while other clients are given access to the other  pool,  so[m
       these subclasses are declared without scopes.  If part of the purpose of the subclass were to define different[m
       parameter values for some clients, you might want to declare some subclasses with scopes.[m
[m
       In the above example, if you had a single client that needed some configuration parameters, while most didn't,[m
       you might write the following subclass declaration for that client:[m
[m
       subclass "allocation-class-2" 1:08:00:2b:a1:11:31 {[m
         option root-path "samsara:/var/diskless/alphapc";[m

       }[m
[m
       In  this  example,  we've used subclassing as a way to control address allocation on a per-client basis.  How‚Äê[m
       ever, it's also possible to use subclassing in ways that are not specific to clients - for example, to use the[m
       value  of  the  vendor-class-identifier  option  to  determine what values to send in the vendor-encapsulated-[m
       options option.  An example of this is shown under the VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS head in the [1mdhcp-options(5)[0m[m

========================================

/etc/sysconfig/[7mnetwork-scripts[27m/ifup:
/etc/sysconfig/[7mnetwork-scripts[27m/ifdown:

  Symlinks to /sbin/ifup and /sbin/ifdown, respectively.
  These are the only two scripts "in" this directory that should
  be called directly; these two scripts call all the other
  scripts as needed.  These symlinks are here for legacy purposes --
  only /sbin/ifup and /sbin/ifdown should currently be used
  at the user level.

  These scripts take one argument normally: the name of the device
  (e.g. eth0).  They are called with a second argument of "boot"
  during the boot sequence so that devices that are not meant to
  be brought up on boot (ONBOOT=no, see below) can be ignored at
  that time.

  Also, interfaces may be brought up via the hotplug scripts;
  in this case, HOTPLUG=no needs to be set to no to avoid this.
  This is useful e.g. to prevent bonding device activation by merely
  loading the bonding kernel module.
